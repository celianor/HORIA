    <h1>Child of Earth in the Court of Saturn</h1>

    <p>
      In the violet mist and icy rings of Saturn stood a great court, with a transparent ceiling through which the stars whispered. There, law spoke loudest—and hearts, even if they spoke, were seldom heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, a child of Earth—a young man from that dusty, wounded planet—arrived. He wore simple clothes, but his gaze glowed with inner light, and his voice was calm, as if born from the soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first judge, whose voice rang like metal on stone, asked:<br>
      “Traveler, tell us what justice is.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy smiled and said:<br>
      “Justice means everything in its rightful place. Not only weights and scales, but also hearts and words. If you sell bread, your heart should be softer than its crumb. If you judge, your hand must not tremble when the weak stand before you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The second judge, with eyes like flowing water, said:<br>
      “But here, everything is measured by data and code. The heart has no number!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy replied:<br>
      “True, the heart has no number. But without the heart, numbers mean nothing. Intention cannot be displayed on a screen—but when you forgive someone, the world becomes a little softer.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The third judge, the eldest, with a voice like wind in dry leaves, asked:<br>
      “If this justice is so good, why can't we create it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      The Earth-boy bowed his head and said:<br>
      “Because you seek justice without error. But true justice finds its meaning through mistakes. It is not perfect, nor without flaw. Yet if it is honest, it is as clear as water, even when a bit muddy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Silence fell—not a cold silence, but one of thought, like when a child considers something new.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old judge said:<br>
      “We need a law that is soft but firm. Not harsh, yet not weak. Is such a path possible?”
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy gently said:<br>
      “The path begins with the heart. Law must listen not only to the mind, but to the soul. There must be room for forgiveness, for understanding—for hearing even the one who has no right, but is still human.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The judges looked at each other. No one spoke, but something in that court began to shift—not the law, but its tone. Not justice, but its taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Earth-child left in silence. But his footprints remained on Saturn’s ice—not made of snow, but of belief.
    </p>
