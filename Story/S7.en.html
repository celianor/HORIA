  <h1>The Merchant and the Balance – A Parable of the Sun</h1>

  <p>I saw a merchant in a passage of the City of the Sun. When he placed his goods upon the scale, he fixed his gaze long upon the balance, as though seeking truth in the weight and justice in the iron. Then he sighed and reflected deeply.</p>

  <p>The buyer asked: “O man of justice and master of the market, why do you doubt the scale? Could iron be at fault?”</p>

  <p>The merchant replied:<br>
  “Iron, though hard, is softer than the heart of man, which sometimes inclines without awareness.<br>
  And if the outer scale appears fair, what use is it if the inner scale is crooked?<br>
  In the Horia path, first the scale of the heart must be aligned—then the hand’s scale earns its worth.<br>
  The heart is the scale of truth, and iron merely its visible tool.<br>
  If the heart is bent, what can iron do?<br>
  A scale without inner honesty,<br>
  though adorned with gold and stones,<br>
  is of no use.<br>
  For a man is known by his honesty, not by his beard or fine garments.”</p>

  <p>He asked: “If a heart is bent, to whom should one turn?”</p>

  <p>He said:<br>
  “To the judgment of the people. For if a man does not reflect upon himself, and cannot bear his own criticism, he has no place in the market of the worthy.<br>
  In the mirror of the community, one sees the true and the false.<br>
  In the court of justice, a scale without owner is placed, and the people are invited to weigh, so that truth may emerge from the view of all.”</p>

  <div class="quote">
    He who dares not face his own faults<br>
    is banished from the market of men.<br>
    And if you are unjust to yourself,<br>
    you are not fit for your mission.
  </div>

  <div class="quote">
    The wise have said:<br>
    He whose inner balance is unjust—<br>
    even if he comes to the market, is no buyer of ours.<br>
    And he who is not upright in the mirror<br>
    is not worthy of the people’s measure.
