  <h1>Collective Reflection and the Light of Wisdom</h1>

  <p>A wise king would summon the elders each morning and ask:<br>
  “Which path shall we take? What is worth saying, and what is better left unsaid?”<br>
  He would say: “Wisdom, left alone, remains in darkness.<br>
  A mirror shines by the sun;<br>
  and a lamp alone gives little light.<br>
  But lamp beside lamp can push back the night.”</p>

  <p>A thought, left by itself, withers;<br>
  but when it flows and is shared, it becomes a clear and living stream.</p>

  <p>A man was building a wall, yet each time it collapsed.<br>
  They asked, “Did you not seek advice?”<br>
  He replied, “I have much knowledge.”<br>
  Another came, reversed a single brick, and the wall held firm.<br>
  So, one sees: knowing is not enough, if one cannot listen.</p>

  <p>Words are like seeds—they grow better in the soil of others.<br>
  And opinions are like breezes—kept inside, they grow stale;<br>
  but when they stir among many, they bring freshness and life.</p>

  <blockquote>
    If you seek no counsel, what gain is there?<br>
    He who scorns advice shall surely burn—sooner or later.
  </blockquote>

  <p>I saw a man walking in the night with a torch in hand,<br>
  yet he knew not which way to go.<br>
  He had the light—but not the path.</p>

  <p>I saw another without a torch, but traveling with a caravan.<br>
  He had no flame, no knowledge of the way—yet arrived in safety.<br>
  Thus I learned: in dark paths, counsel is the blind man’s lantern,<br>
  and the group is the staff of reason.</p>

  <p>A lone thought is like a blade in the dark—sharp but useless.<br>
  A shared thought is like the sun—warming and illuminating.</p>

  <p>He who is ashamed to ask grows familiar with loss;<br>
  but he who seeks the voice of the wise is spared regret.</p>

  <p>But let us ask: why do we sometimes avoid asking?<br>
  Perhaps we fear appearing small, or have grown large in our own eyes.<br>
  Yet one who does not ask is neither free nor aware—he is bound by himself.</p>

  <p>A sage once said: “Speech is easy;<br>
  but listening comes from an awakened heart.<br>
  And one who sits among the wise, even in silence, will still learn.”</p>

  <p>Wisdom does not fall from the sky, nor grow in solitude alone.<br>
  It is the spirit of being that flows through us—<br>
  in dialogue, in listening, in learning, in sharing presence.</p>

  <p>Collective wisdom is like a garden, where every flower blossoms from a different corner;<br>
  and the right opinion is like a breeze in that garden, carrying the fragrance of each flower to the next.</p>

  <blockquote>
    No single gaze can see the whole of what must be done.<br>
    A thousand eyes are needed—one is not enough.
  </blockquote>
