    <h1>The Tale of the Child Who Wrote the Law</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>It is told that in a land beyond the plains, people lived under a law that neither arose from their hearts nor blended with their souls. The words, cold and stern, were carved in stone—not written on the hearts of men. And the people, not knowing why, had grown used to obedience, and not seeing a way out, dared not speak.</p>

    <p>One day, a child rose among them—pure-hearted and humble. He wore no robe, bore no turban, held no seat in any council, nor boasted of learned lineage. But there was a light upon his face, and a truth in his gaze, such that hearts were drawn to him unbidden.</p>

    <div class="quote">
      “Tell me,” he said, “why do you write laws for me without me? It is my tomorrow that must walk behind them. Why not ask the one who must inherit these lines? Am I not also human—with a trembling heart and a breath that shines?”
    </div>

    <p>Laughter rose from the crowd, and an elder with the weight of experience in his beard replied:</p>

    <div class="quote">
      “O boy, we speak from wisdom and years. You have yet to learn the game from the grave.”
    </div>

    <p>But the child bore no anger; his heart was clear as spring water. Smiling, he said:</p>

    <div class="quote">
      “If experience lacks a heart, it is no light—but a chain. Was it not experience that justified injustice and named obedience a virtue? If it comes without love, what is it but habit dressed as wisdom?”
    </div>

    <p>The crowd fell silent, and their eyes sank into thought.</p>

    <p>Among them were a few of the Horians—those who saw not by age or robe, but by soul and insight. They came to the child, held his hand, and said:</p>

    <div class="quote">
      “You carry a message that may show us the way. Come, and let us write the first line of law anew.”
    </div>

    <p>So they formed a council—not in a palace with golden tiles, but on plain earth, beneath open sky, among the people. And they began to speak, not from legal codes, but from the depths of being.</p>

    <p>They asked:</p>

    <div class="quote">“Whom do we write the law for? In what language, and with what breath?”</div>

    <p>And the child replied:</p>

    <div class="quote">
      “For the human who is alone, yet still hopes. For the heart that trembles and the eyes that weep. For those who refuse to be ruled—neither by king, nor prophet, nor the law itself.”
    </div>

    <p>And thus, the first clause of the Horian law was inscribed:</p>

    <div class="quote">
      “No law is just unless it wins the consent of the awakened heart. And no power deserves command unless it guards the dignity of the human being.”
    </div>

    <p>And the people, this time, embraced the law not from fear, but from affection; not out of force, but from longing. For the words were their own, and in them they found the reflection of themselves—not the shadows of tired orders.</p>

    <p><strong>A law written without love shall not be accepted with love; and where the law cannot reach the understanding of a child, there is no justice in it.</strong></p>
