  <h1>In the Mirror of Will and Wisdom</h1>

  <p>I asked: “Who are you?”</p>
  <p>He said: “The one others expect me to be.”</p>
  <p>I replied: “Then you are neither yourself nor your essence; a mirror that reflects only the world outside.”</p>

  <p>Another said: “I follow my own path.”</p>
  <p>But he was faulted for worshipping isolation as if it were truth.</p>
  <p>Will, if it rises from the soul but turns away from the world, becomes either passion without guidance or path without fire.</p>

  <div class="verse">Unbridled will turns to peril,<br>but chained by reason, it grows inert</div>

  <p>A tree without roots does not grow, and roots without light do not thrive.<br>
  Wisdom is the root, will is the light.<br>
  One without the other bears neither branch nor fruit.</p>

  <div class="verse">To know oneself is the start of the path;<br>to understand with others is its perfection.</div>

  <p>A youth set out on a journey and said: “Why seek advice when I already know all?”</p>
  <p>He carried a map in his mind, but did not know the signs of the road.</p>
  <p>He wandered lost for three days, until he reached a stream.</p>
  <p>An old man sat there and said: “Had you asked, you would already have arrived.”</p>
  <p>The youth replied: “I did not want to be indebted to anyone.”</p>
  <p>The elder smiled: “Debt belongs to the idle, not the seekers. To ask is to be awake.”</p>

  <div class="verse">Listen to the wise, and set sail—<br>for it is with the help of the crew that the captain charts the waves</div>

  <p>Collective wisdom without individual will falls asleep in silence;<br>
  and the lone will, without seeking common insight, burns itself out.</p>
  <p>Unjust will becomes tyranny;<br>
  blind obedience becomes servitude.</p>

  <p>Ask, even if you think you know the answer—<br>
  for the question is a window to the light,<br>
  and only in light can one tell the path from the false trail.</p>

  <p>If wisdom is not weighed on the scale of the many,<br>
  how can right be told from wrong?<br>
  And one who shatters the mirror—<br>
  how will he see the measure of his beauty or his flaw?</p>

  <p>Will is command, and wisdom is compass.<br>
  To rely on one without the other is either stagnation or misdirection.</p>

  <div class="verse">One has no lamp, and sees nothing at night;<br>another holds a lamp, but is lost in the desert</div>

  <p>He who rises by his own will becomes as firm as the mountain;<br>
  he who seeks counsel from the just flows like a river;<br>
  and one who unites both becomes a tree—rooted in earth, reaching the sky.</p>

  <p>Do not mistake will for stubbornness;<br>
  nor counsel for submission.<br>
  Counsel is an invitation to clarity, not a debt;<br>
  and will is persistence in truth, not insistence on self.</p>

  <p>A bird was born in a cage; it knew nothing of flight.<br>
  Though the door was open, it believed the cage was home.</p>
  <p>Another had wings but knew not the wind; its flight was short and weary.</p>
  <p>A third had wings and knew the art of soaring;<br>
  when the wind rose, it rose and flew.</p>

  <div class="verse">Reach yourself, and you do not forsake the world;<br>Reach the world, and you do not lose yourself</div>
