  <h1>The Star Seeds</h1>

  <p>Long ago, in a village nestled at the foot of green hills and a forest of whispering trees, lived a boy named Nova. His heart was like a clear mirror: bright, yet shadowed by sorrow.</p>

  <p>His mother — whose voice once sang like the breath of the wind — had wandered into the forest and never returned. His father went to search for her and was also lost. Since then, every night, Nova sat by the window of his little hut, gazing at the sky and whispering:  
  “Will a light ever come to pierce this darkness?”</p>

  <p>The village, too, seemed to have fallen into slumber. The spring, once joyful and clear, had dried up. The trees stood in silence, the villagers passed one another coldly, and only the birds sang now and then — their songs sounding like weeping for the vanished water.</p>

  <p>One night, when the moon shone like a silver lamp, a magical breeze arose. The door of Nova’s hut opened, and a lady appeared, clothed in a gown woven of starlight. Her hair shone like threads of moonlight, and in her hands she carried a pouch that pulsed like the very heart of the heavens.</p>

  <p>She spoke:  
  “Nova, these are the Star Seeds, a gift from the heavens. If you sow them with kindness into human hearts, the spring will flow once more, and a bridge of light will rise to eternity.”  
  Nova asked, “But how can one plant a seed in a heart?”  
  The Star Lady smiled: “With hands that help, with eyes that see without expecting, and with a voice that binds souls together.”  
  Then she placed the pouch in his hands and vanished like a ray into the wind.</p>

  <p>Nova walked into the forest, where the trees bowed in silence. He took a shining seed from the pouch. At once, the trees whispered: “Nova, sing… sing your mother’s song.”  
  Nova, who still carried the melody deep in his memory, sang softly:</p>

  <p><em>O star, O endless light,<br>
  Show the path to my yearning heart.<br>
  Through kindness, smile, and purity,<br>
  I will build a bridge of light to the sky.</em></p>

  <p>The wind carried his song to the village. A girl named Luna, who lived alone in an old hut, heard it. The villagers thought she was cursed, for her mother too had vanished in the forest. But Nova came to her with a glowing flower and warm bread, sat beside her, and said:  
  “Come, let us sing the song of the stars together.”  
  Though fearful at first, Luna slowly joined him with a trembling voice. At that moment, a trickle of water flowed from the dry spring, and Nova saw a Star Seed sprouting in Luna’s heart, its light rising to the sky.</p>

  <p>Days later, Nova met a boy named Eli, weeping at the edge of the forest: his little bird, his only companion, was trapped in the branches. Nova sang, and the trees softened, releasing the bird. Eli embraced him with joy and sang with him. That day, another stream of water ran at the spring, and another light rose skyward from Nova’s heart.</p>

  <p>But in the village lived a man named Shadow, whose heart was like a dark cloud. He scoffed: “These songs are nothing but illusions! Nova seeks to deceive us.” One day, he hid the Star Seeds in the forest.  
  Yet Nova did not grow angry. He came to Shadow and said: “Come, let us seek the seeds together and sing.”  
  He sang, and the trees whispered until the seeds reappeared. Ashamed, Shadow sang for the first time beside Nova. Then the spring burst forth in full, and an even greater light rose to the sky.</p>

  <p>Winter came, and snow covered the village in white. But the spring now sang clear and strong, and the villagers, once estranged, gathered around the fire to sing with Nova:</p>

  <p><em>O star, O endless light,<br>
  Show the path to my yearning heart.<br>
  Through kindness, smile, and purity,<br>
  I will build a bridge of light to the sky.</em></p>

  <p>Each night, Nova lifted his eyes to the heavens and saw a bridge of stars linking his heart to infinity. Upon this bridge shone the lights of Luna, Eli, Shadow, and the whole village: each act of kindness adding a new star.</p>

  <p>One night, under the dance of snow, the Star Lady returned. Beautiful and gentle, her eyes glimmered like a galaxy.  
  She said: “Nova, through your song of kindness you have restored the spring and built a bridge uniting hearts with the heavens. Your parents are with you in this light.”  
  Nova, weeping, asked: “Do they hear me when I sing?”  
  She answered: “Every note draws you closer to them. Now they sing with you on the bridge of light.”</p>

  <p>In that moment, the trees, the spring, and even the stars sang with Nova. He felt his heart become part of the shining bridge itself.  
  From then on, the villagers believed that each act of kindness and each echo of Nova’s song added another star to the bridge — and that the spring would forever sing, as though a paradise had bloomed upon the earth.</p>
