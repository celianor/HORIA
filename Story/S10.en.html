    <h2>The Breath of a Smile</h2>

    <p>In the midst of hardship, a smile opens the way; in the silent night, it becomes a light.<br>
    A smile does not rise from ease but from insight; not from comfort, but from calm.</p>

    <p>Whoever is at peace with themselves is at peace with the world.<br>
    The one whose lips bear grace holds a secret within the heart.<br>
    A smile is wine without a cup, a song without words, a flame without fire, a fire without smoke.</p>

    <p>Not every smile is kindness, and not every silence is anger.<br>
    A smile that comes from a luminous heart enlightens other hearts—just as a candle lights another without dimming its own flame.</p>

    <p class="verse">With one sincere smile, night turns to dawn;<br>
    A soul rises from sorrow, and the eyes are reborn.</p>

    <p>A smile is the language of the voiceless, the story of untainted hearts.<br>
    The smile of the virtuous is a prayer; the smile of the wise, a remedy; the smile of the lover, a greeting.</p>

    <p>When the heart is captive to anger, the lips are sealed.<br>
    When peace returns, the lips begin to dance.<br>
    A smile is a pearl born of silence, adorning the soul.</p>

    <p class="verse">Smile, dear friend, for your smile<br>
    Is a tribute from the kingdom of joy.</p>

    <p>Every smile born of love is a mirror of the soul;<br>
    And every smile born of deceit is a mask upon the face of falsehood.<br>
    A genuine smile rises not from teeth, but from the soul itself.</p>

    <p class="verse">If you see their smile, you see no sorrow—<br>
    For their heart is full of light, and their lips full of dew.</p>

    <p>Be with others in such a way that even your silence is remembered with grace,<br>
    And when you speak, let your smile be the voice of hearts.<br>
    A smile may be a sign of forgiveness, a mark of dignity, or a silent prayer granted without a word.</p>

    <p class="verse">How sweet the moment when a heart<br>
    Blooms from the joy of your smile.</p>
