    <p>Once upon a time, in a distant land where sky and earth embraced in silent whispers, and where stars glittered like droplets of dream across the night, lived a young girl named <strong>Diane</strong>.</p>

    <p>She was unlike the other children of the village; her laughter did not rise from simple meadow games, but from a deep question, tender as a faithful shadow: “Who am I? Why am I here? What is the secret of this vast world?”</p>

    <p>One quiet night, while the moon shone like a silver lantern above the village and a soft breeze caressed the leaves, Diane stepped out of her little hut and walked into the ancient forest. Beneath an age-old oak, whose branches seemed to cradle the stories of the heavens, a gentle light appeared.</p>

    <p>It was not harsh like the sun, nor trembling like a candle in the wind; it was warm, welcoming, a murmur born from the heart of existence itself.</p>

    <p>Then a voice rose, calm and tender, like a mother embracing her child: “Diane, child of light, why have you come into the silent night of the forest?”</p>

    <p>Astonishment filled her eyes as Diane answered: “My heart is heavy with questions. The world is like a book whose words I cannot understand. Why am I here?”</p>

    <p>The light smiled — a smile that set the breeze dancing and stirred the leaves to song. “I am the One who shaped you not from dust, but from a spark of the infinite. Not by command, nor by decree, but out of love. I wanted you to be a mirror in which I might behold myself. You, Diane, are a story at the heart of creation, not a forgotten mark at the margin of time.”</p>

    <p>Diane lowered her head, her voice trembling: “But I am small, frail. How can I be your mirror?”</p>

    <p>The light drew nearer, as if to whisper a secret: “Within you I placed a flame that no storm can extinguish, save by your own will. That flame is your questioning, your kindness, your thought. Each time you share your bread, each time you offer a smile to a sorrowful face, that flame grows brighter.”</p>

    <p>“And if I lose my way?” asked Diane. “If the heavy nights weigh me down?”</p>

    <p>The light replied: “I am not in lofty palaces nor in grand rituals. I am in the moment you reach out to one in need, in the silence you keep in respect of another. Seek me in love, not in chains of command. If you walk toward me, I will be as a faithful friend, the lamp upon your path.”</p>

    <p>From that night on, Diane was never the same. Her eyes brimmed with wonder: every grain of wheat held a hidden garden; every smile she gave, a spark to her inner flame; and every question blossoming in her heart drew her closer to that tender light.</p>

    <p>Yet Diane’s story is not hers alone — it is the story of all the children of the earth. For every heart that questions carries a flame within. And that gentle light — which neither rules nor binds — waits, in quiet silence, in a moment of love, ready to embrace you and whisper into your ear the secret of existence.</p>
