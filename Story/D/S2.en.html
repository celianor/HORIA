    <h1>Painting on the Water</h1>

    <p>It was sunset.<br>
    The sky, like a child’s sketchbook, was full of faded, hidden colors:<br>
    a bit of misty white and grey,<br>
    a tired shade of gold,<br>
    and blue lines drifting from the day’s dreams.</p>

    <p>The yard was quiet. Only the distant chirping of a sparrow and the soft rustle of a tree calming itself in the breeze.</p>

    <p>Diane, as always, stood peacefully by the pool, a gentle smile on her face.<br>
    In her fingers, she held a red petal from the old geranium in the garden,<br>
    the way poets hold a rare word before they speak it aloud.</p>

    <p>Then, without saying a word, she placed the petal on the water.<br>
    The surface of the pool trembled;<br>
    like the moment you suddenly fall in love with someone.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">“Look, Dara… it's like a painting… on the water.”</p>

    <p>Dara, younger and more cheerful, ran closer.<br>
    His wide, questioning eyes sparkled.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">“It’s so pretty… But look! The shape’s changing… The ripples are carrying the painting away.”</p>

    <p>A gentle breeze passed through the jasmine bushes.<br>
    The water trembled like a longing heart.<br>
    The image of the petal tilted, stretched, faded…</p>

    <p>Diane frowned slightly—not out of anger, but a soft sorrow for something she couldn’t keep.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">“But I wanted it to stay… just like that.”</p>

    <p>Dara shrugged, as if he had lived many more years.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">“Everything changes, Diane. Like this picture… But that doesn’t mean it isn’t beautiful, right?”</p>

    <p>I, watching them from the other side of the yard, felt that time paused for a moment.<br>
    Like when someone speaks a truth without realizing it.</p>

    <p>Diane sat down, hugging her knees.<br>
    Her voice turned soft and slightly sad, like the glow of a lamp in the night:</p>

    <p class="dialogue">“So… things that go away can still be beautiful?”</p>

    <p>Dara said:</p>
    <p class="dialogue">“Yes… If you try to keep them, they disappear. But if you just watch them, and let them go… they stay in your heart.”</p>

    <p>Another breeze arrived.<br>
    As if from those worlds Diane sometimes dreamed of.<br>
    The petal spun, drifted away, vanished.</p>

    <p>But Diane’s smile stayed on her face, in that twilight.</p>

    <p>And then she said, as if speaking to the wind:</p>

    <p class="dialogue">“Then let the world paint… even on the water.”</p>

    <p>And I still believe that the most beautiful paintings in the world<br>
    are drawn upon water…<br>
    and remain in the heart.</p>

    <blockquote>
      Some images are not meant to stay…<br>
      They come to stir the soul,<br>
      like a painting on the water,<br>
      beautiful while they last,<br>
      and when they leave,<br>
      they leave a trace of light within you.<br><br>

      Don’t cling to what must go;<br>
      let it go,<br>
      so that something deeper remains in you:<br>
      acceptance,<br>
      kindness,<br>
      and the memory of that radiant moment,<br>
      when your heart smiled… for no reason.
