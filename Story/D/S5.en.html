  <h1>Dara and the Village</h1>

  <p>Once upon a time, nestled among rolling green hills, there was a small village at peace. At dawn, the crow of roosters and the bleating of sheep echoed through its earthen lanes, and at dusk, the air was filled with the fragrance of freshly baked bread from clay ovens. The villagers lived simply: working in the fields by day, and at night gathering around the fire to share tales of hardship and joy.</p>

  <p>Among them was a boy named Dara; his hands were stained with soil, but his heart was full of questions. While others clung to the plow, he wondered:  
  “Is life nothing more than sowing and reaping? Or must I strive for a brighter horizon beyond this?”</p>

  <p>One night, an old sage known as Wind — a former teacher of the village — approached, leaning on his wooden staff. Gazing into Dara’s eyes, he said:  
  “There is a question hidden in your gaze. For years you slept in innocence, and now you have awakened. You ask why you are here.”</p>

  <p>Dara sighed:  
  “I see the hardships of the people, but I am young, and no one listens to me. What power do I have to change anything?”</p>

  <p>Wind smiled gently:  
  “Every human being plants a seed in the soil of existence. Your choices are seeds; what you plant today will grow in hearts tomorrow. Go and find where you may sow your seed.”</p>

  <p>The next day, Dara met Sophie, a poor widow carrying an empty basket and eyes heavy with sorrow. Drought had left her fields barren. Dara brought her a sack of grain from his own store and said:  
  “Take this and feed your children; next year we will water your fields together.”</p>

  <p>Sophie, her eyes brimming with tears, replied:  
  “You have given me more than bread; you have given me hope.”  
  That night, Dara’s heart was lighter than a feather.</p>

  <p>Soon after, a bitter quarrel arose between two neighbors, Madi and Luca, over a shared plot of land. Each claimed it as his own. Voices rose in anger. Dara stepped forward and said:  
  “Land was made for friendship, not enmity. Divide most of it fairly between you, and keep a small part for the village, so the needy may share in its fruit.”</p>

  <p>Though doubtful at first, they agreed. That year, their land yielded such abundance that the whole village was fed, and strife gave way to friendship.</p>

  <p>But a greater test awaited. The village chief, seeking to solve the hunger of the poor, decreed: “Half of every farmer’s harvest shall go to the communal granary, to feed the needy and meet public needs.” The people obeyed, but their hearts were heavy.</p>

  <p>Dara, unable to bear the silence, went to the chief and said:  
  “Your law was born of fear of famine, but if it lacks fairness, it will breed famine of the heart. Let us set a new rule: each household gives one-quarter of its harvest to the communal granary to ensure safety through winter. Beyond that, let each who has more give freely, so that generosity may be remembered with honor. Thus, the granary ensures survival, and giving ensures dignity.”</p>

  <p>The chief frowned:  
  “And if someone refuses?”  
  Dara answered:  
  “The share for the granary must be required of all, but what exceeds that is voluntary. He who gives more not only fills bellies but nourishes hearts as well.”</p>

  <p>The chief pondered these words, and his heart softened. The villagers gathered in the square and wrote a new law: the granary for survival, generosity for honor. That winter, no home was left without bread, and the village tasted the sweetness of solidarity.</p>

  <p>Years passed. Dara was no longer just a farmer; he had planted new seeds in the soul of the village: seeds of hope, justice, and compassion. And every spring, as the wheat fields turned green again, he remembered Wind’s words:  
  “Every choice is a seed that grows, in the earth and in the heart.”</p>

  <p>Thus, Dara’s name endured in the history of the village; not for the hands that broke the soil, but for the heart that sowed light.</p>
