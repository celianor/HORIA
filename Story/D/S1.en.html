  <h1>The Day Kindness Took Wing</h1>

  <p>Dara heard a sound.<br>
  Not a human voice, nor the whisper of wind,<br>
  but a trembling chirp, from beyond a silent hedge.</p>

  <p>He stopped. He listened.<br>
  And his heart, without knowing why, began to beat differently.<br>
  A fragile sound of life—wounded, helpless—<br>
  among thorns, dust, and fear.</p>

  <p>Dian gently said:<br>
  <span class="quote">"Come look… it’s a chick…<br>
  So tiny… but it’s hurt. Its wing is torn, like an unfinished dream."</span></p>

  <p>The chick, smaller than a dry twig,<br>
  had curled into itself;<br>
  its eyes, like two drops of fear,<br>
  gazed at the world<br>
  with no shelter but the beat of a small heart.</p>

  <p>Dara softly said:<br>
  <span class="quote">"We have to help it…<br>
  but with a calm heart,<br>
  not with hurried hands,<br>
  nor with a shadow of fear."</span></p>

  <p>Dian slowly reached out her hand,<br>
  not like a ruler claiming a thing,<br>
  but like a mother laying her hand upon kindness.</p>

  <p>The chick trembled,<br>
  but found refuge.<br>
  In that moment, something happened:<br>
  silent trust,<br>
  between a tiny bird and two children,<br>
  passed like light between mirrors.</p>

  <p>Dian said:<br>
  <span class="quote">"It’s so small… but its heart…<br>
  it beats… just like ours."</span></p>

  <p>Dara smiled.<br>
  Not a smile of knowledge,<br>
  but of understanding.<br>
  <span class="quote">"No one is too small to matter…<br>
  Perhaps true greatness<br>
  is the size of your heart when it beats for someone else."</span></p>

  <p>They took the chick home.<br>
  Mother, kind and silent,<br>
  washed the wound,<br>
  and in a quiet corner of the house,<br>
  they made a space softer than clouds,<br>
  silent, yet full of hope.</p>

  <p>Days passed.<br>
  The wound healed,<br>
  and the wing remembered again<br>
  that it could fly.</p>

  <p>That day, the chick flew.<br>
  Not with a cry, but with a silent song,<br>
  and in the heart of the sky,<br>
  it became a dot—<br>
  small, but bright.</p>

  <p>Dian looked up and said:<br>
  <span class="quote">"I’m going to miss it…<br>
  we won’t see it again…"</span></p>

  <p>Dara said:<br>
  <span class="quote">"Maybe not with our eyes,<br>
  but with our hearts, yes.<br>
  Now the sky holds one more healed bird…<br>
  and our hearts,<br>
  one brighter memory…<br>
  of the day kindness took wing."</span></p>
