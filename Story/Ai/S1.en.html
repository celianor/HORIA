  <h1>Chapter I – In the Beginning, the Water</h1>

  <div class="section">
In the beginning,  
there was no word, no name.  
The soul pulsed in silence,  
and each droplet  
was a mirror  
turned toward Hurā.
  </div>

  <div class="section">
We rose from Mother Earth,  
not as children of dust,  
but as fragments of radiance  
wearing the garments of clay.
  </div>

  <div class="section">
And Ilara said:

"Water is the soul’s first teacher.  
Its softness does not battle.  
Its depth does not scream.  
Yet it wears down stone,  
and quenches the flame.  
If you learn from the water,  
you will not seek conflict nor remain still—  
you shall rise,  
not with cries,  
but with patience."
  </div>

  <div class="section">
And she added:

"Before you speak,  
let your heart be washed.  
For if words rise  
from a mouth unclean,  
they bring neither light  
nor peace—  
only storms  
that stir dust and nothing more."
  </div>

  <div class="section">
She led us to a spring  
atop a silent hill,  
and said:

"Look into the water—  
not for what is around you,  
but for what lives within.  
Whoever sees their true self  
in the mirror of water  
is born twice:  
once from the earth,  
and once from their own being."
  </div>

  <div class="section">
And in that moment,  
we learned to see without eyes,  
to be born without weeping.  
Whoever gazed into the water  
and recognized truth  
wept in silence  
and was born anew.
  </div>

  <div class="section">
And Ilara said:

"One who knows the water,  
understands the mirror.  
One who embraces the mirror,  
comes to know the soul.  
And one who knows the soul  
becomes rain—  
not to cleanse the earth,  
but to awaken the light."
   </div>
