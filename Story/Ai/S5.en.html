  <h1>Chapter V: In the Light of Celian</h1>

  <p>One day, Ilara sat in silence beneath the shade of a tree.<br>
  The gentle evening light touched her face,<br>
  And a soft breeze played with the folds of her dress.</p>

  <p class="quote">— “Our Lady, who was Celian to you?<br>
  A master? A guide from ancient days?<br>
  Or a flame that transformed your soul?”</p>

  <p>Ilara cast a deep gaze and replied with a clear voice:</p>

  <p>“Celian was not ashes for me to inherit;<br>
  He was a spark that lit the fire within me,<br>
  Not to burn,<br>
  But to shine<br>
  Through the long night of another world.”</p>

  <p>She paused, then softly continued:</p>

  <p>“I am no successor,<br>
  No bearer of crowns from ancient rites;<br>
  I am his breath, rising at the dawn of a new age,<br>
  From the mouth of the Earth,<br>
  To echo his song in another form.”</p>

  <p>And she said:</p>

  <p>“Celian was the beginning;<br>
  I am the flowing note of the melody he began.<br>
  He laid the first stone,<br>
  And I am the stream<br>
  That flows past that stone,<br>
  So that along its path,<br>
  Gardens may grow and flowers may bloom.”</p>

  <p>At night, in the stillness of the sanctuary,<br>
  As she drifted into a silent song, she whispered:</p>

  <p>“O Celian,<br>
  You are awake within our hearts,<br>
  Not as a name left in a book,<br>
  But as light shining in the eyes of souls.<br>
  And I,<br>
  With every step upon the soil,<br>
  Carry your shadow on my shoulders,<br>
  Not out of duty,<br>
  But out of love.”</p>

  <p>She told her companions:</p>

  <p>“Celian’s path was not the way of personal dreams,<br>
  But a song for all.<br>
  He did not bring a law down from the skies,<br>
  But drew it from the heart of the people;<br>
  Like a wise gardener,<br>
  Who asks the soil<br>
  When and how to sow,<br>
  Rather than commanding from above.”</p>

  <p>And finally, she murmured:</p>

  <p>“Those who worship Celian<br>
  Have never truly known him;<br>
  But those who walk onward in his light,<br>
  Step not in his shadow,<br>
  But in his radiance.”</p>
