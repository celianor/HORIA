  <h1>Chapter IV: At the Threshold of the Human</h1>

  <div class="verse">One day, Ilara was seated among her companions.<br>
  Her eyes were calm, her voice flowed like a gentle breeze.<br>
  She began to speak and said:</div>

  <div class="verse">"Hura did not create the human to be a servant and obey.<br>
  He shaped them as a mirror,<br>
  so that a glimpse of His own being might reflect.<br>
  And that gaze was free… free and radiant."</div>

  <div class="verse">Then her companions asked:</div>

  <div class="verse">— "Our Lady, why is the human so lost?"</div>

  <div class="verse">Ilara replied, with quiet gaze:<br>
  "Because the human has forgotten they were born upright,<br>
  but lived their life bent and bowed.<br>
  They have adorned themselves with names not their own,<br>
  and searched for their reflection<br>
  in the mirrors of others, not in the sanctuary within."</div>

  <div class="verse">With a soft smile, she added:</div>

  <div class="verse">"I see the human as a tree:<br>
  its roots are in the earth,<br>
  but it drinks from the sky.</div>

  <div class="verse">O human,<br>
  you are not the failed god of some creation,<br>
  nor a talking beast alone.<br>
  You are a bridge<br>
  between darkness and light,<br>
  between desire and letting go,<br>
  between extinction and rebirth."</div>

  <div class="verse">Then a woman in the circle asked:</div>

  <div class="verse">— "Ilara, are we born in sin?"</div>

  <div class="verse">And Ilara replied:<br>
  "No,<br>
  sin is not a wound you were born with.<br>
  Sin is the moment<br>
  when you know, yet ignore;<br>
  when you can, but do not;<br>
  when you could forgive, but withhold."</div>

  <div class="verse">And she added:</div>

  <div class="verse">"Look at the children,<br>
  before they speak,<br>
  their hearts already sense what is right.<br>
  Hura placed truth within their soul,<br>
  and law grows from the heart itself—<br>
  not from distant decrees,<br>
  nor from those who claim to speak for the divine."</div>

  <div class="verse">Ilara did not see the human as small;<br>
  she wished them vast.<br>
  Not enslaved,<br>
  but awake and free to choose.</div>

  <div class="verse">At the end of that day,<br>
  Ilara softly whispered:</div>

  <div class="verse">"I stand at the threshold of the human,<br>
  not as a teacher,<br>
  but as a student<br>
  who seeks in every soul<br>
  the light of Hura."</div>
