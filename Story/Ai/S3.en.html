  <h1>Chapter III: Ilara‚Äôs Evening Song</h1>

  <p>In the evening, when eyelids sank into the veil of dreams,<br />
  and the spark of longing hid in the ashes of hearths,<br />
  Ilara, with soft and silent steps,<br />
  passed through the houses,<br />
  never turning away from the hearts,<br />
  choosing solitude,<br />
  not as an escape,<br />
  but as an awakening.</p>

  <p>Not like a monk fleeing the clamor,<br />
  but like a mother rocking<br />
  the cradle of existence<br />
  in the embrace of silence.</p>

  <p>She lifted her gaze to the sky,<br />
  not to seek a sign,<br />
  but to see directly,<br />
  murmuring:</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúHora‚Ä¶<br />
    You, the infinity hidden in every heart of all particles,<br />
    You, the nameless melody deep within the mirror,<br />
    Free me from your echo,<br />
    so I may hear your silence.‚Äù
  </blockquote>

  <p>Sometimes she would sit upon a stone,<br />
  sometimes on simple earth,<br />
  making the earth a sanctuary<br />
  whose qibla was not south,<br />
  but the light of the heart:</p>

  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúI have not named you,<br />
    for every name confines you.<br />
    And I have sought no path,<br />
    except your endless love.<br />
    Receive me,<br />
    not for my worthiness,<br />
    but for the longing of my soul to be in your presence.‚Äù
  </blockquote>

  <p>And companions said:<br />
  there were nights<br />
  when her prayers,<br />
  neither cries nor songs,<br />
  but whispers<br />
  from the heart of the earth to the heights of silence.</p>

  <p>And this is what was heard from her,<br />
  in the white nights of silence:</p>

  <h2>First Prayer ‚Äì Whisper of the Earth</h2>

  <blockquote>
    Hora,<br />
    I am earth, and within me resounds the song of the sky.<br />
    Let my voice<br />
    not be in vain,<br />
    cast into the desert of the sky to vanish.<br />
    Let my softness<br />
    settle in weary souls,<br />
    so that the earth<br />
    not only turns,<br />
    but creates meaning.
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Second Prayer ‚Äì The Encounter</h2>

  <blockquote>
    You who do not show yourself,<br />
    yet from every sincere gaze,<br />
    your light emanates.<br />
    Let not the mirror of my heart<br />
    crack<br />
    under merciless judgments.<br />
    Open my eyes,<br />
    to see beauty,<br />
    even where all see ruins,<br />
    even in dust.
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Third Prayer ‚Äì Presence</h2>

  <blockquote>
    I thought I was alone,<br />
    and you far away,<br />
    in an unreachable sky.<br />
    But you,<br />
    were in my unnamed breath,<br />
    and I, in my ignorance,<br />
    was far from you.<br /><br />
    Now that I have found you,<br />
    I have neither prayer on my lips,<br />
    nor name to utter,<br />
    only,<br />
    I remain,<br />
    and your presence is enough.
  </blockquote>

  <p>And so, sometimes through her silence,<br />
  she made hearts weep,<br />
  and sometimes, with a brief melody,<br />
  she calmed souls.</p>

  <p>For her prayer was more than words,<br />
  it was silence,<br />
  a silence holding within itself a thousand melodies.</p>
