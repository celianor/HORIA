  <h1>Chapter IX: Breaking, and Rising Again</h1>

  <p>Ilara said:</p>

  <blockquote>
    "No one stands forever,<br>
    and no fall is the end of the path."
  </blockquote>

  <p>And on a day when many hearts were heavy,<br>
  in a soft voice, like a breeze over ruins, she said:</p>

  <blockquote>
    "If you collapse,<br>
    know that your old home had become too small.<br>
    If you break,<br>
    know that something new within you wished to be born."
  </blockquote>

  <p>To those who were ashamed of their suffering,<br>
  Ilara rose and said:</p>

  <blockquote>
    "There is no shame in tears,<br>
    no disgrace in falling.<br>
    Disgrace lies where your soul is burning,<br>
    and you pretend there is no ash."
  </blockquote>

  <p>And then she added:</p>

  <blockquote>
    "I too have been broken,<br>
    not once,<br>
    but many times.<br>
    And each breaking<br>
    became a window to the light;<br>
    not as a reward,<br>
    but as a chance to see<br>
    what joy had once hidden from my eyes."
  </blockquote>

  <p>She spoke of suffering:</p>

  <blockquote>
    "Suffering is like water:<br>
    it either grows the flower,<br>
    or erodes the stone.<br>
    And it is you who must choose to be the flower or the stone."
  </blockquote>

  <p>Someone asked:</p>

  <blockquote>
    — "My Lady, what if we fall again and again,<br>
    and cannot rise anymore?"
  </blockquote>

  <p>And Ilara replied:</p>

  <blockquote>
    "Rising is not always of the body;<br>
    sometimes, simply having hope<br>
    is a form of rising.<br>
    Sometimes, merely staying alive<br>
    is proof that the light has not gone out."
  </blockquote>

  <p>She also said:</p>

  <blockquote>
    "The more broken one is,<br>
    the more light shines from within;<br>
    for it is through the cracks<br>
    that the light finds its way."
  </blockquote>

  <p>And in the quiet night that closed this chapter,<br>
  she sat on the ground and whispered:</p>

  <blockquote>
    "O you who are broken,<br>
    know that within you<br>
    there is something unbroken—<br>
    something even breaking could not destroy.<br>
    And that is the light of Hora in you."
  </blockquote>
