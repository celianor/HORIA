<h1>🕊️ How to Join the Horia Faith</h1>

<p><strong>❤️ If these beliefs have blossomed within you…</strong></p>
<p>
If you feel deep down that you are worthy of being loved,<br>
If you love your fellow humans and want to make the world a better place,<br>
If you believe in true integrity, freedom of heart and conscience, and mutual respect,<br>
If you long for a life of meaning, lived in dignity and light…<br>
Then maybe it's time to discover Horia —<br>
A new faith, for a new human,<br>
A faith that begins within you.
</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>✨ A simple, clear, and direct path</strong></p>
<p>
In Horia, joining happens through inner light, not through ceremonies or intermediaries.<br>
Anyone who sincerely believes, with mind and heart, in <strong>Hora</strong> as the one divine source, and accepts the three pillars of Horia, is a full Horian.<br>
There is no need for witnesses, certificates, or obligatory rituals.<br>
Only awareness, freedom, and honesty matter.
</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>🌿 To join, you simply:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Recognize <strong>Hora</strong> as the one god and source of life,</li>
  <li>Commit to freedom, dignity, and light,</li>
  <li>And walk your path with love, meaning, and conscience.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><strong>🗣️ Declaration of Faith:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
I, with my reason and with all my heart,<br>
believe in Hora as the one divine source,<br>
and I accept the faith of Horia.<br>
Freedom – Dignity – Light<br>
Horam, Horam, Horam
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p><strong>🌱 A New Life, A New Way</strong></p>
<p>
With this declaration, a new life begins.<br>
As a Horian, one strives to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Act with kindness,</li>
  <li>Approach others with a smile and respect,</li>
  <li>Stay true to one’s own freedom and that of others,</li>
  <li>And honor the rights of people and public will in collective life.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Horia means living with inner light,<br>
loving life and humanity,<br>
staying awake, staying free, and staying noble.
