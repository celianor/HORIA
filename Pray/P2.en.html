  <h1>Inner Calling</h1>

  <p>O Hora, light without a name,<br />
  Murmur without lips,<br />
  Presence that shines even in your absence,<br />
  You pulse within my chest<br />
  Though unseen by my eyes,<br />
  And you flow through my tears<br />
  Though I know not your name.</p>

  <p>O Hora, unseen companion,<br />
  Mirror of the world's living conscience,<br />
  I call you by name — Hora —<br />
  Not because you require a name,<br />
  But because my heart cannot stay in love with the nameless alone.</p>

  <p>In the solitude of my soul, I whisper your name,<br />
  So each twist in the path<br />
  Becomes a lesson in hidden mysteries.</p>

  <p>O timeless friend of the spirit,<br />
  How could I not speak of you,<br />
  When in every breath, you are present,<br />
  And in every longing, a trace of your distance remains?</p>

  <p>I lay my heart at your doorstep,<br />
  Not out of fear,<br />
  But out of thirst for meeting.<br />
  I walk the path,<br />
  Not to arrive,<br />
  But to hear the echo of my steps within your presence.</p>

  <p>I have seen the stones along the road,<br />
  And I have understood:<br />
  Every thorn is a messenger,<br />
  And each wound—a mirror<br />
  To see myself with you.</p>

  <p>O Hora,<br />
  Boundless light,<br />
  Grant me a vision<br />
  That separates desire from truth;<br />
  And a heart<br />
  That, in passing beyond itself,<br />
  Finds its way into your clarity.</p>

  <p>Let my breath flow like a river,<br />
  Not trapped in ponds of craving,<br />
  But pouring into the ocean of meaning.<br />
  Make my hands as gentle as the breeze,<br />
  That they may caress the mountain of hardness<br />
  Instead of trying to break it.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of others,<br />
  I glimpse your light;<br />
  I understand that in every sorrow,<br />
  There is a footprint of your compassion,<br />
  And in every joy,<br />
  A trace of your smile.</p>

  <p>O secret hidden in silence,<br />
  Take me to the depths within,<br />
  To the stillness where words retreat in shame,<br />
  And presence cries out without sound.</p>

  <p>And when the final veil falls,<br />
  And my soul settles like a drop<br />
  Upon the leaf of the endless garden,<br />
  Let your name shine within me,<br />
  And my song<br />
  Become a hymn of global conscience,<br />
  For those still walking the way.</p>

  <p><strong>Amen, O Light of Lights,<br />
  Amen, O Hora without borders.</strong></p>
