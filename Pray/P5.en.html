  <h1>Prayer of the Rain of Kindness</h1>

  <p>O Hora, O boundless rain, O silent caress of weary hearts,<br />
  You who descend from unseen heights, blooming in my soul without a sound.<br />
  You rain not out of merit, but from the very essence of love—<br />
  Not from judgment, but from the limitless nature of your mercy.</p>

  <p>O Soul of all souls,<br />
  You are the tenderness of rain on the earth’s cheeks,<br />
  The quiet kiss upon the forehead of sorrow.<br />
  I praise you,<br />
  Like a mother who loves without noise,<br />
  And offers her affection not to the sun,<br />
  But to the midnight tear and the unseen hand.</p>

  <p>My heart, O infinite tenderness, thirsts to be quenched by you;<br />
  Rain upon me,<br />
  Let me lose myself in the softness of your love,<br />
  So that on the cracked soil of my heart, long parched,<br />
  Seeds of peace and gentleness may grow.</p>

  <p>O Hora,<br />
  I whisper your name softly,<br />
  As a lover repeats the name of the beloved under their breath,<br />
  Unheard by others,<br />
  Yet all the sky knows the ache.</p>

  <p>Let your kindness flow in my veins,<br />
  So each heartbeat spreads its scent.<br />
  Quench my lips with a cup of kind words,<br />
  So my every speech becomes a balm, not a wound.</p>

  <p>Let me, with gentle steps, shower the earth with blossoms,<br />
  And with eyes that have learned tenderness,<br />
  Shape a world anew—<br />
  A world where no one remains alone in the thirst for love.</p>

  <p>Amen,<br />
  O infinite tenderness,<br />
  O Soul of all souls,<br />
  O Hora.</p>
