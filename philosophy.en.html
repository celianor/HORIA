<div class="content">
  Horia is a religion as old as human history.<br><br>Not a religion for obedience to religious rulers or oppressors, but one for awakening, peaceful coexistence, and devotion to collective wisdom — while protecting individual freedoms.<br><br>Its prophets are many — thousands, named and unnamed, among the people.<br><br>Its temples are everywhere people gather to decide with kindness: in schools, councils, communities.<br><br>Horia is the continuation of Socrates’ quest, the echo of Zoroaster and Kant, the vision of Spinoza, and the dream of kind, life-loving humans.<br><br>In Horia, no one speaks for God — yet every human can hear the divine.<br><br>This religion was not made for domination, but for liberation;<br><br>Not for a fake heaven in the sky, but for building a real one on Earth.
