        <h1>Teachings of the Horia Faith<br />Celian the Prophet<br />"At the Threshold of the Soul"</h1>

        <h2>Chapter Four: Silence, the First Prophet</h2>
        <p>Days had passed, or perhaps only moments. In that realm, time was suspended. The traveler asked less and listened more. Not words, but that which comes before words.</p>

        <p>One day, he came to Celian, troubled, and said:<br />
        — "O Celian, I have fallen into silence, but I feel I am nowhere. Why does this quiet not end? Why does no word spring forth from me anymore?"</p>

        <p>Celian smiled and said:<br />
        — "Because you are now at a threshold where language is not permitted. A child experiences silence before learning speech. And a human must pass through the noise of himself before perceiving God. Silence is the first prophet; wordless, without miracles, yet more alive than all the books."</p>

        <p>The traveler sighed.<br />
        — "But I fear the silence. I think I am lost in nothingness."</p>

        <p>Celian said:<br />
        — "You are not lost, but fallen outside yourself. In the clamor of words, you mistook God's voice for your own. Now that you have found your silence, you will hear His voice — not the one who calls you His servant, but the one who whispers in your soul: I am with you, without distance, without a name."</p>

        <p>Then Celian fell silent. A silence deepened so much that even the stones of the mountain seemed to listen.</p>

        <p>The traveler whispered within himself:<br />
        "If this silence is God's voice, then why should I speak more? Why should I silence God's song?"</p>

        <h2>Chapter Five: In the Mirror of Nothingness</h2>
        <p>It is a night without end. The traveler sits alone in a valley; Celian had sent him into this solitude. There is no speech, no light, no sign of a path.</p>

        <p>Lost within himself, he sits not on a rock, but on an invisible precipice. It seems nothing remains beneath his feet except "nothingness". He pondered:<br />
        — "Who am I, without my ignorance? Without my name? Without my faith? Without myself? If nothing remains, what remains?"</p>

        <p>Silence slowly spread in his soul; not that emptiness is good, but like a cup before it is filled, it must be cleansed of all it held before.</p>

        <p>Then, within the heart of darkness, a light appeared. Not from outside, but from the depths within. A calm light, without heat, without shadow.</p>

        <p>Celian, without appearing, spoke to him. Or perhaps, for the first time, the traveler heard Celian’s words within his own heart:</p>

        <p>— "O traveler, until now you have gazed into mirrors where you saw yourself: knowledge, religion, tribe, lineage, experience… Now, here, a mirror lies before you that contains nothing. If you fix your gaze upon it, you will see neither yourself nor false gods, but only naked truth: the One who is, without name, without face, without why."</p>

        <p>The seeker wept. Not from sorrow, nor from joy, but from seeing that which was nothing, and in that nothing, everything shone.</p>

        <p>He said:<br />
        — "I am not, yet I am.<br />
        I am to be destroyed, yet more alive than ever."</p>

        <p>And in that moment he understood that nothingness is not the end, but unveiling. And the mirror of nothingness is the only place where truth can be seen without a veil.</p>

        <h2>Chapter Six: The Encounter, Without Distance</h2>
        <p>After the night of nothingness, the traveler was no longer the same. Neither his garment nor his steps had changed, but the world seemed painted in a different color. The tree spoke to him without words. The water embraced him in silence. And Celian, without presence, was everywhere.</p>

        <p>One day, he returned to the elder with a gaze emptied of questions.</p>

        <p>Celian smiled.<br />
        — "What do you want now, O former seeker?"</p>

        <p>The traveler said:<br />
        — "Nothing. I saw that the One I sought was always with me. The encounter is without distance; separation was a dream of ignorance. I sought Hora, and she was in every beat of my heart. I wanted His voice, but His silence was louder. I thought Him above, but I found Him in the falling tear."</p>

        <p>Celian quietly said:<br />
        — "Yes, the encounter happens when you no longer seek it. You sought the one who was breathing with you. Now you see not with eyes, but with the soul; and what is seen with the soul is never lost."</p>

        <p>The traveler said:<br />
        — "Now I know the path was pathless. I sought the path outside myself, and every step took me farther. But when I stopped, when I fell silent, when I became empty, there was where I found presence; direct, wordless, and without distance."</p>

        <p>Celian said:<br />
        — "Now you are neither a student nor a guide. Now you yourself are the path. And whoever sees you, if they look with their heart, will see me as well."</p>

        <h2>Chapter Seven (Final): The Beginning</h2>
        <p>Another morning, but no longer in need of a beginning. The sun sat on the mountain, not like yesterday, but as if shining from within the traveler. He was now neither searching nor fleeing; he rested in a deep stillness that was not dead silence, but a living presence.</p>

        <p>Celian sat beside him, without a word. Time passed in silence, then he said:<br />
        — "Now, O found friend, it is time to leave."</p>

        <p>The traveler said in surprise:<br />
        — "But I have just arrived!"</p>

        <p>Celian said:<br />
        — "Yes, you have arrived… and whoever arrives must rise. Our journey does not end with not-finding, but with being among those who have not yet arrived. Now, what you have found must shine in your life without any claim; not in preaching, nor in solitude, but in a smile, in work, in giving, in listening."</p>

        <p>The traveler said:<br />
        — "But what if I get lost again? What if the light is lost in the noise?"</p>

        <p>Celian answered:<br />
        — "The light you found in nothingness will never go out. It is within you like fire beneath ashes. Just do not forget that you are a mirror. And a mirror never creates light; it only reflects, faithfully and silently."</p>

        <p>The traveler rose. Not like someone who blindly takes a path, but like one who carries Hora in his heart, and wherever he goes, that light is with him.</p>

        <p>And so, the first volume ended. Not with an end, but with another beginning; because every encounter is a start to living in the light of collective wisdom.</p>
