    <h1>Continuing the Comparative Analysis of Horia with Islam, Christianity, and Buddhism Based on Kantian Moral Philosophy</h1>

    <h2>4. Freedom, Autonomy, and Moral Agency</h2>
    <p>
        Kant considers freedom a prerequisite for morality: only a free will can be moral.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>In Horia, freedom is a foundational element, and no law is sacred unless it is accepted by reason and the collective mind.</li>
        <li>In Islam, freedom is defined within servitude; Sharia determines its boundaries.</li>
        <li>In Christianity, while individual liberty is respected, salvation depends on faith and divine grace.</li>
        <li>Buddhism defines freedom more inwardly, as detachment and release from desire.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Only Horia, like Kant, considers freedom the primary condition for morality and legislation.</p>

    <h2>5. The Relationship Between Religion, Politics, and Society</h2>
    <p>
        Kant advocates for republicanism, public law, and a moral legal society.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Horia builds religious and social structures on criticism, human dignity, and collective reason.</li>
        <li>In Islam, religion and state are often unified, with Sharia forming the foundation of political order.</li>
        <li>In Christianity, the relationship between religion and politics varies among denominations.</li>
        <li>Buddhism has rarely engaged with political structures and remains largely introspective.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> In terms of social structure, Horia aligns more closely with Kant’s vision of moral republicanism than other religions.</p>

    <h2>6. Death and the Afterlife</h2>
    <p>
        Kant believes in an afterlife as a necessary condition for the full realization of justice.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Horia also considers the afterlife a physical and rational continuation of existence—not a field of divine reward and punishment.</li>
        <li>Islam and Christianity view the afterlife as a realm of recompense and judgment.</li>
        <li>Buddhism believes in reincarnation or final extinction (Nirvana), not an individual afterlife.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Horia’s view of death is more aligned with Kantian moral idealism than with traditional punitive models.</p>

    <h2>General Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        In this comparative analysis grounded in Kantian philosophy, Horia can be regarded as “the closest religion to practical reason.”
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Self-grounded ethics,</li>
        <li>Free and rational faith,</li>
        <li>Republican structure,</li>
        <li>And a meaningful view of death,</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These are the features that position Horia within the global religious landscape as a model of the “religion of reason”—a vision Kant described as a seemingly unattainable but ultimately realizable ideal.
