<h1>Chapter 2: The Material Cause of Religion — The Substance of Beliefs</h1>

<p>In Aristotelian philosophy, the material cause is what something is made of: like wood for a table, or stone for a building. Regarding religion, we must also ask: what is it made of? Not in terms of temples and rituals, but rather: what are its cognitive and psychological foundations? Is religion made of tradition, text, inner experience, or collective reason?</p>

<p>In this chapter, we examine the materials of four religions: Are they changeable? Are they rational? Can they be reconstructed?</p>

<hr>

<h2>2.1. Horia: Human Reason, Lived Experience, and Repeatable Kindness</h2>

<p>The material of Horia is not revelation or tradition, but a triad of reason, experience, and collective conscience. Beliefs in Horia are always open to dialogue and reevaluation, as they are not considered “untouchably sacred” in advance.</p>

<p>Horia accepts that religious knowledge—like the humanities—evolves through generations. Its teachings are drawn from the observation of human suffering, shared moral judgments, and open discussions among wise people.</p>

<p>Thus, the material of this religion is dynamic, human, and reformable. Like a flame lit from another, it loses none of its brightness in the sharing.</p>

<hr>

<h2>2.2. Islam: Sacred Text, Prophetic Tradition, and Legal Consensus</h2>

<p>The material of Islam is clearly defined: the Qur’an, Hadith, and the tradition of the Prophet’s companions. These sources are viewed as unchangeable foundations. In Islamic jurisprudence, change is only permitted within the framework of the text.</p>

<p>This religion has a strong material: a network of texts, interpretations, rules, and terminologies. Yet this strength increases its rigidity. Any attempt at reform must arise from within the same tradition, using the same textual language.</p>

<p>Hence, the material of Islam is dense and rigid — like marble: majestic, but hard to reshape.</p>

<hr>

<h2>2.3. Christianity: Holy Scripture, Church Tradition, and Faith Experience</h2>

<p>Christianity, especially in the Catholic branch, is a religion of ancient institutions and millennia-old traditions. Its material consists of the Bible, Church interpretation, and the rituals of faith. In Protestant branches, church tradition has weakened, and individual faith experience has gained prominence.</p>

<p>Still, beliefs in the incarnation, the Trinity, and resurrection are treated as unquestionable. The material of Christian religion is a blend of text and emotion — not as solid as Islam’s, not as open as Horia’s.</p>

<p>It resembles an alloy: resistant to shocks, but brittle when bent.</p>

<hr>

<h2>2.4. Buddhism: Inner Practice, Teacher’s Teachings, and the Personal Mind</h2>

<p>The material of Buddhism is neither text nor institutional tradition, but simple yet profound teachings on suffering, ignorance, and liberation. In Buddhism, what matters is not belief but personal practice of mind and behavior.</p>

<p>Buddhist texts are numerous, but instructional, not revelatory. A Buddhist sees religion as a tool for alleviating inner suffering—not as a path to worship a god. Thus, the material is psychological and process-oriented.</p>

<p>Buddhism is like water in the vessel of the human mind: adaptable, calm, and sometimes silent.</p>

<hr>

<h2>2.5. Comparative Analysis: The Material and Reformability of Religions</h2>

<p>From Aristotle’s point of view, matter should neither be so hard that it cannot be shaped, nor so weak that it cannot take form. Religion, being a human institution, must have a material that balances flexibility and meaning to keep pace with time.</p>

<p><strong>Comparative Summary:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Horia:</strong> Open material, based on reason and experience; reformable and human</li>
    <li><strong>Islam:</strong> Rigid, text-centered material; conditional and difficult reform</li>
    <li><strong>Christianity:</strong> Mixed material of text and feeling; limited but possible reform</li>
    <li><strong>Buddhism:</strong> Personal and mental material; without powerful institution, yet less engaged with society</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, in the Aristotelian view, a religion must strike a balance between “stability” and “dynamism” in its material — a balance best achieved in Horia.</p>
