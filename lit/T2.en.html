    <h1>Analytical Comparison of the Horia Faith with Islam, Christianity, and Buddhism Based on Kant's Moral Philosophy</h1>

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        This article offers a comparative study of the Horia faith and three major world religions—Islam, Christianity, and Buddhism—based on the moral and rational principles of Immanuel Kant.
        The aim is to evaluate the extent to which each spiritual system aligns with Kant’s fundamental ethical ideas, such as autonomy, practical reason, freedom, and faith as a rational postulate.
        It concludes that the Horia faith, grounded in collective reason, human dignity, and rejection of external commands, aligns more closely with Kant’s idea of a “religion of reason” than the others.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        In his philosophical project, especially in the <em>Critique of Practical Reason</em> and <em>Religion within the Bounds of Mere Reason</em>, Kant seeks to liberate ethics from the dominance of external commandments and religious traditions, and instead ground it in autonomous reason.
        The Horia faith, as a moral-centered and progressive spiritual path, similarly claims affinity with the principles of practical reason and moral autonomy.
        This article presents an analytical comparison between Horia, Islam, Christianity, and Buddhism on these philosophical foundations.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Morality as Inner Law</h2>
    <p>
        Kant considers morality to be an inner law of reason—a law that, if truly moral, must be universally applicable.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Horia replaces divine command with conscience and collective wisdom, acknowledging no supra-rational authority.</li>
        <li>In Islam and Christianity, morality is based on revelation and divine command; reason is, at best, a subordinate interpreter.</li>
        <li>Buddhism, with no reference to a divine being, focuses on avoiding suffering and purifying the mind; morality arises through inner empirical insight.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Only Horia, like Kant, views the origin of morality in human reason and will—not in external commandments.</p>

    <h2>3. Faith and the Postulates of Practical Reason</h2>
    <p>
        Kant sees faith in God, immortality, and freedom as necessary assumptions for realizing the highest good, though not provable in theory.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Horia also accepts faith in “Hora” not as imitation, but as a way to give meaning to death and ground benevolence—without coercion or fear.</li>
        <li>Islam and Christianity treat faith as a religious duty and a condition of salvation, often above reason itself.</li>
        <li>Buddhism does not involve faith in a supreme or transcendent being.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Like Kant, Horia treats faith as a regulative principle of practical reason, not a subject of blind obedience or theoretical proof.</p>
