  <h1>Chapter 3: The Formal Cause of Religion – Organization and Order</h1>

  <p>If the material cause is the raw substance of religion, its formal cause is the shaping and organization of that substance. Aristotle considered form as the order and structure that makes a particular phenomenon from matter; like a blueprint that turns bricks into a house.</p>

  <p>Regarding religion, form means: what are the institutions, rituals, hierarchies, religious language, social order, and style of dialogue? Is the religion centralized or participatory? Closed or dialogical? Hierarchical or horizontal and open?</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>3.1. Horia: Participatory, Dialogical Structure Without a Dominant Church</h2>
  <p>In the Horia faith, the form of religion is not based on a central institution or religious authority, but on collective wisdom, free assemblies, and ethic scholars.</p>
  <p>Horia has no mandatory church, domain, or temple. The institutionalized form of religion is defined as Horia halls, dialogical gatherings, councils of wise people, and free web-organizations. Each community can shape its own appropriate structure while respecting fundamental principles.</p>
  <p>The form of religion in Horia is like an open and transparent architecture: changeable, without a power pyramid, focusing on education, beauty, and kindness. In this religion, “ritual” means the practice of virtue, not fixed ceremonies.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>3.2. Islam: Jurisprudential-Legal System with Interpretive Authority</h2>
  <p>The form of religion in Islam is primarily jurisprudential. This religion has an organization centered around Sharia, seminaries, and religious scholars. Although Islam does not inherently have an official church, in practice the hierarchy of religious scholars holds structural power.</p>
  <p>Rituals in Islam are structured with precise times, forms, and rules: prayer, fasting, pilgrimage, almsgiving, and jihad.</p>
  <p>The religious discourse follows a legal framework (permitted/prohibited, obligatory/disliked); religion acts as a comprehensive legal code. Dialogue has a limited place because the final authority is the Quran and Sunnah, not collective wisdom.</p>
  <p>The form of religion in Islam is like a judicial system: with defined rules, interpretive hierarchy, and internal power to maintain coherence.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>3.3. Christianity: Church, Clergy-Centric and Sacred Rituals</h2>
  <p>In the Catholic branch, Christianity has a clear, ecclesiastical, and hierarchical structure. The Pope, bishops, priests, and nuns each have divinely sanctioned roles. Rituals such as the Eucharist, baptism, and confession are all parts of the sacred order.</p>
  <p>In Protestant branches, the form of religion is more flexible and the church institution is weakened, but ritual forms and preaching remain central.</p>
  <p>In both, religion has an order based on “observance of the sacred form” — including clothing, prayer times, language of worship, and religious music.</p>
  <p>The form of Christianity is like a magnificent cathedral: full of light and order, but requiring constant maintenance of its institutional structure.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>3.4. Buddhism: Temples, Monks, and Personal Practice</h2>
  <p>The form of religion in Buddhism varies from East to West. In the Theravada branch, there is a structured system of monks, temples, and disciplinary rituals; while in Zen or Tibetan Buddhism, the form is more based on meditation, mindfulness, and the teacher-student relationship.</p>
  <p>There is religious hierarchy, but not for ruling; rather for guiding individuals in practice. Buddhism’s form is neither revolutionary nor authoritarian, but more like a silent educational system: non-political but structured.</p>
  <p>Its form is like a contemplative garden: organized for inner peace, not for external governance.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>3.5. Comparative Analysis: Religious Form and the Possibility of Secularization</h2>
  <p>Aristotle, in politics and ethics, believed the best order is one that enables public virtue. A form of religion that aids moral practice, citizen development, and wise dialogue is philosophically superior.</p>
  <p>Comparative overview:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Horia:</strong> Horizontal, dialogical form without hierarchy; empowered for democratic society</li>
    <li><strong>Islam:</strong> Jurisprudential, organized form with interpretive authority; suitable for law-based structures</li>
    <li><strong>Christianity:</strong> Ritual-ecclesiastical form; majestic but costly and sometimes authoritarian</li>
    <li><strong>Buddhism:</strong> Calm and practice-based form; suitable for inner life, not necessarily for active social order</li>
  </ul>
  <p>From the Aristotelian perspective, the form of religion should make virtue possible within society. Horia, with open, participatory, and aesthetic institutions, is closest to this ideal.</p>
