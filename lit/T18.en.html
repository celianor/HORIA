  <h1>Health, Sanctity, and Autonomy</h1>
  <h2>A Critical Comparison of Traditional Religions and the Horia Doctrine from a Medical and Psychiatric Perspective</h2>

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>
    Religious beliefs play a double role in human health: they can be a source of meaning, psychological coherence, and peace, but can also become a cause of suffering when they impose unscientific rules or induce guilt. This article offers a critical comparison between traditional religions and the emerging Horia doctrine, focusing on mental health, bodily autonomy, and the experience of death. From a medical and bioethical point of view, it argues that reimagining spirituality in a more humane and participatory form is not only possible, but essential for preserving religion’s salvific function in the modern world.
  </p>

  <h3>1. Introduction: Religion, Meaning, and the Body</h3>
  <p>
    Religion has long served as a human response to the universe, suffering, and death. Yet over time, it has also become a tool for social control, psychological punishment, and enforcement of unnatural rules. Religious experience often fluctuates between sanctity and domination. The Horia doctrine emerges as a modern attempt to recreate sacred experience without perpetuating authoritarian structures.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Mental Health and the Sacred: Peace or Anxiety?</h3>
  <h4>2.1 Religion and Psychological Disorders</h4>
  <p>
    In certain contexts, intensified religious beliefs can lead to disorders such as scrupulosity (religious OCD), depression, or chronic guilt-induced anxiety. Such clinical cases are documented in the DSM-5.
  </p>
  <h4>2.2 Regenerative Spirituality in Horia</h4>
  <p>
    Horia begins with the universal human need for meaning but liberates it from institutional monopolies. Its sacred experience is grounded not in fear, but in beauty and collective wisdom, aligning with logotherapeutic and humanistic models.
  </p>

  <h3>3. The Body and Religion: Autonomy or Control?</h3>
  <h4>3.1 Traditional Religions and Bodily Restrictions</h4>
  <p>
    Many traditional religions impose strict controls on the body—from dress codes and dietary laws to sexual behavior and even access to medical care.
  </p>
  <h4>3.2 Horia and the Ethical Body</h4>
  <p>
    In Horia, the body is part of one's identity, and caring for it is a moral responsibility. Medical decisions are guided by science and individual will, not by rigid decrees.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Death, Suffering, and the Meaning of the End</h3>
  <h4>4.1 Traditional Views on Death</h4>
  <p>
    Classical doctrines often depict death as a moment of divine judgment, surrounded by fear, punishment, or guilt.
  </p>
  <h4>4.2 Horia: Conscious Mortality</h4>
  <p>
    Horia regards death as a natural part of life’s cycle and emphasizes dignity at life’s end. Its perspective aligns with modern palliative care principles.
  </p>

  <h3>5. Institutional Frameworks of Spirituality</h3>
  <h4>5.1 Ecclesiastical Authority</h4>
  <p>
    In most established religions, definitions of God and morality are reserved for an elite few, resistant to reform and unaccountable to the broader public.
  </p>
  <h4>5.2 Horia’s Model: Participation and Knowledge</h4>
  <p>
    Horia advocates for shifting spiritual authority to rational and open institutions such as universities and civic assemblies. The concept of God becomes a shared, evolving construct based on collective experience and reflection.
  </p>

  <h3>6. Conclusion</h3>
  <p>
    From a medical point of view, religion can indeed be a source of healing—provided it is freed from domination and fear. Doctrines like Horia, recognizing humanity’s need for the sacred while reframing it in humanistic and scientific terms, offer a new paradigm of spirituality that harmonizes with both mental and physical well-being.
