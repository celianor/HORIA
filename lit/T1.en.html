    <h1>Why I Became a Horian</h1>

    <p>
        From a Horian's point of view, faith in <strong>Horia</strong> is neither a denial of other traditions nor a self-righteous claim to superiority. It is a humble and reasoned attempt to meet the spiritual needs of today’s humanity—rooted in dignity, freedom, and collective wisdom. In a world that is both thirsty for meaning and plagued by extremism, Horia does not pretend to be the voice of absolute truth, but rather its companion.
    </p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Ethics without fear, faith without coercion</h2>
        <p>Horia grounds morality not in fear of punishment or desire for reward, but in love and human responsibility. There is no place for lashes, executions, exile, or threats of hell. Goodness is valued for its own sake—not as a means to salvation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Living reason, not rigid imitation</h2>
        <p>No idea is exempt from critique in Horia—not even its own teachings. If truth is real, it welcomes dialogue. In this path, faith walks alongside questions, not against them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. Harmony with science, not conflict with knowledge</h2>
        <p>Horia sees knowledge and scientific discovery as paths to knowing <strong>Hora</strong> (the true divine), not as threats to belief. Every discovery that makes life or the world better is welcomed by Horians.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Compassion for all life, not just humans</h2>
        <p>Horia is not human-centered alone; it recognizes dignity in animals, plants, and the Earth itself. The world is not for exploitation—it is for coexistence.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Embracing difference, not claiming monopoly</h2>
        <p>In Horia, religion is neither an identity badge nor a border. Anyone—regardless of language, color, orientation, or path—who stands by truth, compassion, and reason has a place in Horia’s home.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>6. Meaning in death, light in life</h2>
        <p>The belief in life after death is not a threat nor a bribe in Horia—it’s a bridge between the now and the beyond. It brings meaning to kindness even in the face of death’s darkness.</p>
    </div>

    <p>
        <strong>Horia</strong> does not claim to be the end of truth—it strives to be its partner. It does not claim perfection, because it believes perfection lies not in standing on top of the mountain, but in continuing to walk toward the light. Therefore, it welcomes revision—not to retreat, but to evolve.
    </p>

    <p>
        In a world where many traditional religions call themselves the “final” or “perfect” path, Horia speaks with another voice:  
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Any path born of compassion and reason is kin to us. But we have come to build a home where no one feels homeless because of their faith, gender, questions, or differences.
    </blockquote>
