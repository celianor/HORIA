        <h1>A Talk by an Atheist: From Faith to Godlessness, From Religions to Horia</h1>
      </header>

      <article>
        <p><span class="dropcap">D</span>ear friends,</p>

        <p>Today I stand here not to tear down the houses of faith, but to clear the dust from the windows through which we look at the world.  
        I am an atheist—not out of hostility to the heavens, but out of respect for the light that reason has kindled within me.</p>

        <p>For years, like a restless traveler, I wandered from one religion to another, from one temple to the next; from the <strong>Notre-Dame Cathedral</strong> where the choir’s chant shook the ancient roofs, to the <strong>Jameh Mosque of Isfahan</strong> whose tiles connected the sky to the earth, to a small temple in Nepal where an old monk quietly turned a worn rosary.  
        In each, I saw human beauty and meaning—but behind that beauty, there were walls too: walls between "us" and "others," walls stained with blood throughout history—from the <em>Crusades</em> to the <em>Inquisitions</em>, from today’s conflicts in the Middle East to religious struggles in India.</p>

        <h2>Why did I become an atheist?</h2>
        <p>I did not become an atheist as a blind rebellion, but as an answer to an age-old question: Is morality, meaning, and empathy only possible through belief in the supernatural?  
        History and science told me: no. Long before major religions, hunter-gatherer tribes cared for each other without promises of heaven or threats of hell. Today, societies like <strong>Sweden and Norway</strong>, where disbelief is widespread, rank at the top in indicators of coexistence and social justice.</p>

        <h2>Discovering Horia</h2>
        <p>And then, I discovered Horia. A faith without a sealed book, without monopolizing the truth, and not opposed to the presence of an atheist in the circle of dialogue. In Horia, if you ask "why?" or "from where?" they neither silence you nor drive you away, but say: "Let’s think together."  
        For someone like me, often met with closed answers, this is precious.</p>

        <h2>The language of symbols and history’s warning</h2>
        <p>Horia speaks of the "primordial light" and "cosmic harmony." I do not read these as physical truths but as poetry—like Van Gogh’s painting that fills the sky with spirals of light; I know these spirals are not literally in the sky, but I do not deny their beauty.  
        However, history warns: metaphors, if left unquestioned, eventually become clothed as truth. The <strong>creation myth in Genesis</strong>, once perhaps a poetic metaphor, over centuries came to be regarded as "scientific fact," and even today in some societies, evolution education is challenged. This is a danger Horia must avoid.</p>

        <blockquote>
          "Preserve the freedom to question, and do not let the language of poetry become a chain on the mind."
        </blockquote>

        <h2>A brief comparison with other religions</h2>
        <p>If I were to compare:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left:18px; color:var(--muted);">
          <li><strong>Islam</strong>: Based on Sharia and revelation, with a structure that sometimes makes criticism and change difficult.</li>
          <li><strong>Christianity</strong>: With the concept of salvation through a divine intermediary, an idea conflicting with the atheist’s principle of individual responsibility.</li>
          <li><strong>Buddhism</strong>: Although it lacks a personal god, the cycles of karma and samsara lack solid empirical evidence in my view.</li>
          <li><strong>Horia</strong>: Instead of frozen truth, it offers a living process of dialogue—meaning even the non-believer can find a place within it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Faith in humanity</h2>
        <p>I have not entrusted my faith to the heavens, but to humanity: to the reason that asks, the heart that gives, the hands that build the world and repair ruins.  
        And if one day a fire breaks out in our alley, I and a Horia follower will run shoulder to shoulder to put it out—without first asking each other "Which god do you believe in?"</p>

        <p>Horia may not be my home, but it is a neighbor whose window is open to dialogue. And in a world full of walls, having such a neighbor is a rare blessing.</p>

        <p style="margin-top:22px; font-weight:600;">Thank you for listening.</p>
