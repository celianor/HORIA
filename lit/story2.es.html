        <h1>Teachings of the Horia Path<br>Celian the Prophet<br><em>At the Threshold of the Soul</em></h1>

        <h2>Chapter Four: Silence, the First Prophet</h2>
        <p>Days had passed, or perhaps only moments. In that realm, time had ceased. The traveler asked less and listened more—not to words, but to that which precedes them.</p>
        <p>One day, he approached Celian, troubled, and said:<br>
        — "O Celian, I have fallen into silence, but I fear I am in nothingness. Why does this silence not end? Why do words no longer flow within me?"</p>
        <p>Celian smiled and said:<br>
        — "Because you now stand at a threshold where language is not permitted. A child, before learning to speak, experiences silence. And man, before perceiving the Divine, must transcend his own clamor. Silence is the first prophet; wordless, without miracles, yet more alive than all books."</p>
        <p>The traveler sighed.<br>
        — "But I fear silence. I feel lost in nonexistence."</p>
        <p>Celian replied:<br>
        — "You are not lost; you have stepped outside yourself. Amidst the noise of words, you mistook your own voice for that of the Divine. Now that you have found your silence, you will hear His voice—not one that calls you His servant, but one that whispers within: I am with you, without distance, without name."</p>
        <p>Then Celian fell silent. A silence so profound that even the stones of the mountain seemed to listen.</p>
        <p>The traveler murmured within:<br>
        "If this silence is the voice of the Divine, then why speak more? Why silence the voice of the Divine?"</p>

        <h2>Chapter Five: In the Mirror of Nothingness</h2>
        <p>It is an endless night. The traveler sits alone in a valley; Celian has sent him into this solitude. There are no words, no light, no signs of a path.</p>
        <p>He is lost within himself, not sitting on a stone, but on an unseen precipice. Beneath him, there seems to be nothing but 'nothing.' He pondered:<br>
        — "Who am I, without my knowledge? Without a name? Without faith? Without self? If nothing remains, what remains?"</p>
        <p>Silence slowly enveloped his being; not that emptiness is good, but like a cup that must be cleansed of all it previously held before being filled anew.</p>
        <p>Then, in the heart of darkness, a light appeared. Not from outside, but from the depths within. A gentle light, without warmth, without shadow.</p>
        <p>Celian spoke to him without appearing. Or perhaps, for the first time, he heard Celian's voice within himself:</p>
        <p>— "O traveler, until now you have looked into mirrors where you saw yourself: knowledge, faith, tribe, lineage, experience... Now, before you is a mirror that reflects nothing. If you gaze into it, you will see neither yourself nor false gods, but only the naked truth: that which is, without name, without face, without reason."</p>
        <p>The seeker wept. Not from sorrow, not from joy, but from seeing that which was nothing, and in that nothingness, everything shone.</p>
        <p>He said:<br>
        — "I am not, yet I am. I have perished, yet I am more alive than ever."</p>
        <p>And at that moment, he understood that nothingness is not an end, but a revelation. And the mirror of nothingness is the only place where truth can be seen unmasked.</p>

        <h2>Chapter Six: Encounter, Without Distance</h2>
        <p>After the night of nothingness, the traveler was no longer the same. His clothing had not changed, nor his steps, yet the world appeared in a different hue. The tree spoke to him without words. Water embraced him in silence. And Celian, though absent, was present everywhere.</p>
        <p>One day, he returned to the elder, his gaze devoid of questions. Celian smiled.<br>
        — "What do you seek now, former seeker?"</p>
        <p>The traveler said:<br>
        — "Nothing. I saw that what I sought was always with me. The encounter is without distance; separation was the dream of ignorance. I sought Hora, and she was in every beat of my heart. I desired His voice, but His silence was more resonant. I thought Him above, but found Him in the descent of tears."</p>
        <p>Celian softly said:<br>
        — "Indeed, the encounter occurs when you no longer seek it. You were in pursuit of one who was your breath. Now you see not with eyes, but with the soul; and what is seen with the soul is never lost."</p>
        <p>The traveler said:<br>
        — "Now I understand that the path was no path. I sought the way outside myself, and each step took me further away. But when I stood still, when I became silent, when I emptied myself, it was there that I perceived Presence; without mediation, without words, without distance."</p>
        <p>Celian said:<br>
        — "Now you are neither disciple nor master. Now you are the path. And whoever sees you, if they look with the heart, will see me as well."</p>

        <h2>Chapter Seven and Final: The Beginning</h2>
        <p>Another morning, yet without need of a beginning. The sun rested upon the mountain, not as yesterday, but as if shining from within the traveler. He was now neither in search nor in flight; he rested in a profound stillness, not a dead silence, but a living presence.</p>
        <p>Celian sat beside him, without words. A time passed in silence, and then he said:<br>
        — "Now, O found companion, it is time to go."</p>
        <p>The traveler, surprised, said:<br>
        — "But I have just arrived!"</p>
        <p>Celian said:<br>
        — "Yes, you have arrived... and whoever arrives must rise. Our journey does not end in not finding, but in being among those who have not yet arrived. Now, what you have found must shine in your living, without claim; not through preaching, not in solitude, but in smiles, in work, in giving, in listening."</p>
        <p>The traveler said:<br>
        — "But what if I become lost again? If the light is lost in the clamor?"</p>
        <p>Celian replied:<br>
        — "The light you found in nothingness will not extinguish. It is within you, like a fire beneath ashes. Just remember that you are a mirror. And a mirror never creates light; it only reflects it, faithfully and silently."</p>
        <p>The traveler rose. Not as one who takes an unknown path, but as one who carries Hora within his heart, and wherever he goes, that light is with him.</p>
        <p>And thus, the first book came to an end. Not with an end, but with another beginning; for every encounter is a beginning to live in the light of universal wisdom.</p>
