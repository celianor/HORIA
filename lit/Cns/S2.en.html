    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>You are on the path and weary,</p>
            <p>Suffering is not your enemy;</p>
            <p>It is a clear mirror,</p>
            <p>To better know yourself.</p>
            <p>It is sent from the depths of your soul,</p>
            <p>To bring you back to your own home.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Suffering is a light in the night of the soul;</p>
            <p>If you turn away, you remain lost in darkness,</p>
            <p>But if you gaze upon it, its brightness shines upon you,</p>
            <p>Not to burn, but to illuminate.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Resilience is like a tree that in fierce winds,</p>
            <p>Does not break or bend;</p>
            <p>Its roots grow deeper in the hard soil of life,</p>
            <p>Becoming stronger and steadier.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>O heart, do not fear breaking.</p>
            <p>He who breaks you will rebuild you,</p>
            <p>And he who rebuilds will make you no longer as before;</p>
            <p>But like steel in fire, harder, brighter, and more precious.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Suffering is neither a heavy burden,</p>
            <p>Nor an incurable wound;</p>
            <p>It is an invitation to depth and silence,</p>
            <p>To reflection and understanding.</p>
            <p>Suffering is an unwelcome but truthful messenger of the inner self.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Meaning is not born in comfort,</p>
            <p>But in the rough waters,</p>
            <p>Among waves of bitterness and hardship,</p>
            <p>The lotus flower blooms.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Shared suffering is a bridge over separations,</p>
            <p>That unites hearts,</p>
            <p>And turns loneliness into compassion;</p>
            <p>A bridge that draws us closer.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Companion on the path, if sometimes the world forgets you,</p>
            <p>Remember you have also built the world,</p>
            <p>And if a structure falls,</p>
            <p>Perhaps it is time to rise, pillarless but truthful.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Remember, after every dark night, a new day dawns;</p>
            <p>Be patient and nurture hope in your heart,</p>
            <p>For life is always flowing, fresh and renewed,</p>
            <p>And the sun will shine again.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Resilience is not mere resistance,</p>
            <p>But dancing amid storms,</p>
            <p>A melody of conscious life,</p>
            <p>That cries out: I am still alive.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Sufferings are the polishers of the soul,</p>
            <p>Each blow removes rusty layers of confusion,</p>
            <p>And brings us closer to purity.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Suffering is not meaningless.</p>
            <p>Meaninglessness is that suffering left unanswered.</p>
            <p>But if you ask, if you stand, if you let it speak,</p>
            <p>It may open you, not break you.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
