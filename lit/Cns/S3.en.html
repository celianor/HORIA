  <h1>Book III: In the Luminous Nights</h1>
  <h2>Sometimes, darkness is brighter—if your eyes are free from the light of habit.</h2>

  <div class="verse">
    <strong>1.</strong><br>
    Night is not an end;<br>
    it is a beginning unseen by eyes, yet felt by the heart.<br>
    In the night, the world hides nothing from you — rather, you become more bare to yourself.
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    <strong>2.</strong><br>
    When all are asleep, and you remain awake,<br>
    you will hear the footsteps of silence.<br>
    It has not come to frighten you, but to take your hand and guide you into your depths.
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    <strong>3.</strong><br>
    Sleep is not a sibling of night;<br>
    sleep is escape from night.<br>
    And the one who remains awake, with all the sorrow and brightness of the dark,<br>
    it is they who grow.
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    <strong>4.</strong><br>
    Light does not always shout.<br>
    Sometimes it spreads like a breath,<br>
    in the mist, in the eye of a tear, beside the shadow.
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    <strong>5.</strong><br>
    If night comes to you, do not hide.<br>
    Let it sit, lay its head upon your shoulder,<br>
    and ask: “Are you still afraid of yourself?”
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    <strong>6.</strong><br>
    I have seen many worship the day,<br>
    but ignore the night.<br>
    Not knowing that the seed of the sun is planted in the blackness of night;<br>
    like a grain that longs to sprout in dark soil.
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    <strong>7.</strong><br>
    Sometimes what you desire does not come.<br>
    Not from cruelty, but from a knowledge you do not yet possess.<br>
    And night is the silence needed before the answer.
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    <strong>8.</strong><br>
    Do not fear being lost.<br>
    In starless nights,<br>
    even if you see nothing,<br>
    a new star is born,<br>
    if you do not stay in place,<br>
    if, like a river, you seek your own path.
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    <strong>9.</strong><br>
    Darkness is a frameless mirror.<br>
    If you can bear to look into it,<br>
    you will see yourself, without veil.
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    <strong>10.</strong><br>
    O traveler, salvation will not always come by the road.<br>
    Sometimes, you must sit in the midst of fear,<br>
    and slowly, gently, tame it.
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    <strong>11.</strong><br>
    Night is not the time for dreaming;<br>
    it is the time to live without decoration.<br>
    If you have the courage to remain silent,<br>
    you will find your dream in waking.
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    <strong>12.</strong><br>
    And know, O child of luminous nights,<br>
    that darkness is not the enemy of light;<br>
    it is its teacher.<br>
    Without it, no light has meaning.<br>
    Darkness is the womb where light is nurtured;<br>
    like a child in the belly of the night.
