  <h1>Book I: At the Dawn of the Soul</h1>

  <blockquote class="intro">
    For the beginning of all things lies in silence, and every awakening comes from a deeper dream.
  </blockquote>

  <div class="verse">
    <div class="verse-number">1.</div>
    O newly breathed soul, rising from the horizon like the breath of dawn,<br>
    You are still untouched by lies, unbroken by the echoes of the past.<br>
    Now, the world asks you: "What do you wish to become?"<br>
    And you may choose to remain silent, or to sing your song.
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    <div class="verse-number">2.</div>
    Life is another name for opportunity;<br>
    A chance to be—not as others wish you to be,<br>
    But as your soul whispers in secret.
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    <div class="verse-number">3.</div>
    Dawn is not a time of day, but a state of soul.<br>
    Whoever rises again and lays despair aside has seen the dawn—<br>
    Even in the midst of their own midnight.
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    <div class="verse-number">4.</div>
    Do not let the world draw its map upon you<br>
    Before you have sketched your own dreams.<br>
    For then, you will no longer be yourself, but a copy among many.
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    <div class="verse-number">5.</div>
    Before you seek to change the world, sit and ask yourself:<br>
    "Have I passed through silence? Have I found my own voice?"<br>
    Without this, all change is surface, and at its core, repetition.
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    <div class="verse-number">6.</div>
    Test yourself—not to judge, but to discover.<br>
    Your heart is a mirror that may reveal the unseen,<br>
    If you wipe away the dust of habit.
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    <div class="verse-number">7.</div>
    Make peace with yourself before going to war with the world.<br>
    For many warriors have drawn their swords<br>
    Unaware that the enemy was within.
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    <div class="verse-number">8.</div>
    At the dawn of the soul, truth is simpler:<br>
    Wisdom is a smile. Faith, a step. Love, nameless.<br>
    Yes, words have not yet veiled the face of meaning.
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    <div class="verse-number">9.</div>
    See each day as the first day of creation.<br>
    Such a gaze will renew the world,<br>
    And free you from the chains of repetition.
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    <div class="verse-number">10.</div>
    The beginning of the path lies within;<br>
    The outer world is but a reflection of the soul’s journey.<br>
    Whoever knows themselves holds all the maps.
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    <div class="verse-number">11.</div>
    The child within you still lives, if you let it speak.<br>
    It asks about stars, not profit or loss.<br>
    It walks the path by longing, not by command.
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    <div class="verse-number">12.</div>
    And know this, O seeker of light: dawn never ends<br>
    If you offer your soul to clarity each day.<br>
    The sun is not in the sky—it is in your gaze.<br>
    And if it shines, the world will shine as well.
  </div>
