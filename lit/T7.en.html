  <h1>Chapter 4: The Efficient Cause of Religion – Initiators and Driving Force of Religion</h1>

  <p>In Aristotle’s natural philosophy, the efficient cause is the agent or creator that brings something into existence. Regarding religion, the question arises:
  Who initiates religion? What force moves it forward? And upon whose shoulders does religion stand?</p>

  <p>Is religion the product of individual genius? An inner experience? Or a response to specific historical conditions? And subsequently, who keeps it alive?</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>4.1. Horia: Collective Wisdom, Healers of the Soul, and Lived Experience of Suffering</h2>
  <p>The initiator of Horia is neither a prophet, nor a saint, nor a miracle worker, but a thoughtful and suffering human. In this religion, there is no individual founder whose words are above criticism. Rather, religion is built as an intergenerational conversational network by soul healers, caring mothers, wise people, and thoughtful benefactors.</p>
  <p>The main agent in Horia is the shared human suffering and the empathetic response of wisdom. The driving force of religion is not a promise of otherworldly salvation but the desire for a better life for all.</p>
  <p>In this sense, Horia is the religion of “ordinary people” — albeit noble and intelligent ordinary people.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>4.2. Islam: A Unique Prophet, Divine Revelation, and a Compliant Community</h2>
  <p>In Islam, the efficient cause of religion is the one God, the Creator, and the sender of revelation. Muhammad ibn Abdullah, the Prophet of Islam, is a divine messenger tasked with delivering the message—not merely a great teacher.</p>
  <p>The secondary agent is the Prophet who establishes religion and organizes the community. After him, religious scholars, narrators, and jurists continue this movement.</p>
  <p>Thus, Islam has a singular, transcendent agent, progressing through a chain of meaning transmission via a special prophet and obedient followers.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>4.3. Christianity: The Incarnate Christ and the Witnesses of Faith</h2>
  <p>In Christianity, the main agent of religion is God the Father incarnate as the Son—Jesus Christ. The religion begins with the appearance of Christ; he is not merely a teacher but “the Word made flesh.”</p>
  <p>Subsequently, apostles, disciples, and martyrs spread the faith. The ultimate agent remains God, but historically, priests, church councils, and believers play decisive roles.</p>
  <p>The driving force of religion is the testimony of faith and salvation through divine love. The human agent has a more institutional role than in Buddhism, but less juridical than in Islam.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>4.4. Buddhism: Buddha, Personal Practice, and the Circle of Teachers</h2>
  <p>The original agent of Buddhism is Buddha (Siddhartha Gautama), a human who found the path to liberation through contemplation and meditation. In Buddhism, divine agency is absent. This religion arises from the mind and individual human experience, not from external revelation.</p>
  <p>After Buddha, teachers, monks, and diverse traditions continue this practice. The driving force is the desire for peace, mind control, and understanding the cycle of suffering.</p>
  <p>In Buddhism, agency is personal and voluntary: each individual must awaken within themselves.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>4.5. Comparative Analysis: Agency, Autonomy, and Religious Democracy</h2>
  <p>Aristotle, when examining agency, asks how aware, voluntary, and causal the agent is. Religions grounded in a divine agent beyond humanity limit human freedom. Conversely, religions that regard humans as agents plant the seeds of ethics and democracy within themselves.</p>

  <p>Comparative summary:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Horia: collective and human agent; wise, suffering, compassionate; democratic and ethical</li>
    <li>Islam: heavenly and prophetic agent; absolutist, divine-centered, with a compliant community</li>
    <li>Christianity: divine agent in human form; testimonial, salvation-oriented, with church mediation</li>
    <li>Buddhism: human and mental agent; free, individualistic, and non-theistic</li>
  </ul>

  <p>From Aristotle’s perspective, the best agent is one who is voluntary, ethical, and capable of reform. Here, Horia comes closest to the ideal: mortal agents who are aware, wise, and eager to improve human life.</p>
