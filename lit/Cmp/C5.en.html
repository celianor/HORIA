<h1>A Spirituality for All: Cosmopolitanism and Coexistence in Horia versus Traditional Religious Boundaries - Part 1</h1>

<h2>Introduction: From Ethnic Religions to Cosmopolitan Spiritualities</h2>
<p>
In an increasingly interconnected, multilingual, and multicultural world, the question of religion’s and spirituality’s role in human coexistence gains growing importance. Can religion build bridges between cultures, or does it inevitably draw boundaries? Can a spirituality think globally without sacrificing relativism or erasing diversity?
</p>
<p>
The Horia spirituality responds to this challenge with a unique vision: a borderless faith, without a superior people or language, which not only respects difference but sees it as the very essence of the beauty of existence. This article comparatively examines the place of the “Other,” cultural boundaries, and the concept of peace in Horia and other religious traditions.

<h2>1. Traditional Religions: Sacred Boundaries and Exclusive Identities</h2>
<p>
In many classical religions, the definition of “us” and “others” is very strict. The world’s major religions — especially Abrahamic traditions — are often linked to ethnic and cultural identity structures:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>In Judaism, the divine covenant is made with the people of Israel, and salvation is interpreted historically and ethnically. Even modern currents maintain a ritual structure rooted in ethnic monotheism.</li>
  <li>Christianity, though claiming universality, is historically intertwined with empires, official church languages (Latin, Greek, then national languages), and colonization; concepts like “chosen people” or “salvation” have often come with a sense of superiority over other cultures.</li>
  <li>Islam, though presenting itself as “mercy to the worlds,” in practice centers Arabic culture and language, reinforcing the concept of the Islamic ummah with doctrinal and sometimes political boundaries. Classical jurisprudence categorizes the “Other” as unbeliever or dhimmi with a subordinate status.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Within these frameworks, the “Other” (pagan, infidel, non-believer, foreigner) is not considered a fellow traveler but a problem to exclude, conditionally accept, or assimilate. Religious boundaries are often linked to ethnic, linguistic, and historical borders.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>2. Eastern Traditions: Inner Peace, Outer Boundaries</h2>
<p>
In faiths like Hinduism and Buddhism, the focus is on inner peace and personal liberation. However:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>In Hinduism, the caste structure remains intertwined with spiritual teachings and legitimizes structural discrimination. Even mystical currents are not exempt from this stratification.</li>
  <li>Many of these faiths have historically been tied to specific cultures and languages and only globalized in the twentieth century.</li>
  <li>Concepts like karma, dharma, or reincarnation are rarely redefined interculturally.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In these models, although calls for peace and love exist, they are often intra-group. The “Other” is at best tolerated, not recognized as an equal in humanity.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>3. Traditional Religions’ Inability to Cross Boundaries</h2>
<p>
Several key factors prevent cosmopolitanism in traditional religions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sacred language: reliance on languages such as Arabic, Hebrew, or Sanskrit limits concept transmission and creates specific cultural centers.</li>
  <li>Local laws: many religious commands were designed for specific historical-geographical contexts, making them incompatible with a globalized world.</li>
  <li>Exclusive authority: each religion sees itself as the bearer of complete truth and regards others at best as incomplete or misguided, making equal dialogue impossible.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The result is a blockage of genuine intercultural and interreligious dialogue. A faith where identity is still determined by birth and family religion cannot truly become universal.
