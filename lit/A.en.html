    <h1>Why Horia?</h1>
    <h2>A Reflection on the Reason for a New Faith for Contemporary Humanity</h2>

    <p>Throughout history, religion has been much more than a set of rites and commandments. For many, it is a refuge against the absurd, a connection to others, a force to love, hope, and commit. Even today, millions of people worldwide find in religion inner peace, a source of energy, and guidance for their lives. If it liberates and soothes, religion is a source of <strong>well-being</strong>.</p>

    <p>But do traditional religions, in their inherited form, meet the complex needs of modern humans? Have they succeeded in promoting peace, protecting nature, recognizing individual freedoms, and eliminating violence from the religious sphere? Our answer‚Äîwith respect and clarity, but also with courage‚Äîis: <strong>no</strong>.</p>

    <h2>A New Faith for a New World</h2>
    <p>Horia was born from the pains of our century. It is a spiritual path emerging from global concerns: climate crisis, collapse of meaning, social injustices, religious violence, repression of freedoms, and above all, the <strong>experience of a solitary and searching human being in the modern era</strong>.</p>

    <p>We believe that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If religion is <strong>reinvented</strong>, it can become a force of friendship and coexistence;</li>
      <li>If it transcends <strong>hierarchies</strong> and anchors itself in the human community, it can become a space for dialogue rather than blind obedience;</li>
      <li>If it emerges from a <strong>democratic process of belief</strong>, it can become living and creative rather than frozen in inheritance;</li>
      <li>If it is carried not by a single prophet but by a <strong>thinking community</strong>, it can truly belong to all human beings.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Horia does not ask you to be a follower, but to <strong>co-create</strong>. This faith did not descend from heaven; it is <strong>a human construction turned toward the horizon</strong>‚Äîbuilt, refined, and nourished by the hands, hearts, and minds of everyone.</p>

    <h2>Reflecting and Building Together</h2>
    <p>In Horia, no one holds the absolute truth, and no one is the exclusive intermediary of the sacred. Instead of a ‚Äúprophet,‚Äù we believe in <strong>spiritual reflection councils</strong>: processes where belief is formed through <strong>dialogue, lived experience, personal intuition, and collective interaction</strong>.</p>

    <p>Horia does not claim to hold the ‚Äúultimate truth‚Äù; it seeks a living and evolving truth. It is like a river that remains alive thanks to the current of collective thought. Religion here is not an order to follow but an invitation to participate.</p>

    <p>We conceive Horia as a path that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>respects the <strong>democracy of beliefs</strong>;</li>
      <li>recognizes everyone's right to interpret and live the sacred;</li>
      <li>replaces power structures with structures of <strong>cooperation and co-reflection</strong>;</li>
      <li>relies not on prophetic authority but on <strong>collective wisdom</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Neither Rejection Nor Prison of the Past</h2>
    <p>We look at ancient religions with respect, as each has responded with dignity to the needs of its time. But the world has changed; needs have evolved. Religion must be able to <strong>speak to the new human</strong>.</p>

    <p>Horia is a response to current needs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>for meaning freed from oppression;</li>
      <li>for a faith that combines individual freedom and collective responsibility;</li>
      <li>for a theology <strong>that loves nature and protects the Earth</strong>;</li>
      <li>for a structure that <strong>proposes truth without imposing it</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>A Spirituality for Light</h2>
    <p>Horia does not promise paradise, nor threaten hell. It simply says: <strong>let's reflect together, live together, and build together the meaning of the sacred</strong>. This faith is an invitation to clarity, kindness, self-awareness, and responsibility.</p>

    <p>In a noisy world, Horia is a whisper‚Äîthe whisper of human beings who want to redefine religion‚Äînot to dominate, but to pacify; not to divide, but to unite.</p>
