  <p>
    In the Horia faith, joining happens through inner light‚Äînot through rituals or intermediaries.<br>
    Anyone who, with reason and heart, acknowledges Hura as the one God and believes in Horia‚Äôs three pillars is a full Horian.<br>
    There is no need for mediators, certificates, or mandatory ceremonies.<br>
    The only requirements are awareness, freedom, and sincerity.

    Horia means living by the inner light,<br>
    loving life and humanity,<br>
    staying awake, free, and dignified.
