<h1>Link of Light: A Comparative Analysis of the Teachings of Zoroaster and the Horia Religion</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This article presents a comparative analysis of the religious and philosophical teachings of Zoroaster, the messenger of monotheism and truth in ancient Iran, and the Horia religion, a newly emerging faith rooted in spirituality centered on life and poetry. The main goal is to discover fundamental similarities and differences between these two systems of thought to enable dialogue between ancient religious traditions and contemporary spiritual needs. In particular, the concepts of light, freedom, responsibility, nature, evil, and time are examined in depth in both teachings.</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>The Zoroastrian faith, emerging about 3500 years ago in ancient Iran, is one of the earliest monotheistic and ethical systems in the world, founded on the duality of good and evil, freedom of choice, and individual responsibility. Zoroaster’s teachings are transmitted in the sacred texts of the Avesta, especially the Gathas, which are sacred poems written in Old Iranian (Pahlavi).</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Horia religion is a new faith that appeared in the 20th and 21st centuries, arising from contemporary human spiritual needs for peaceful coexistence with nature and emphasizing introspection and poetry. Though recent, Horia is rooted in ecological concerns, individual spirituality, and liberation from rigid rites of traditional religions.</p>

<p>Despite the significant historical and cultural gap, these two teachings converge surprisingly on several fundamental axes. Their comparative study can serve as a bridge to understand the meaning of light, freedom, and responsibility in the realm of human spirituality.</p>

<h2>2. Light: Symbol of Truth and Path</h2>

<h3>2.1. Light in the Teachings of Zoroaster</h3>
<p>In Zoroastrian texts, light signifies “Asha,” synonymous with truth, cosmic order, and justice. Asha is not only a moral truth but also the law governing the universe, guiding every being towards order and harmony. Zoroaster associates light with the Amesha Spentas, guardians of the world, and light is a symbol of divine inspiration and the purifying power against impurities and darkness.</p>

<blockquote>“Ahura Mazda, god of light, creator of Asha and eternal enemy of falsehood.”</blockquote>

<h3>2.2. Light in the Horia Religion</h3>
<p>In Horia, light has a poetic and inner meaning, distinct from external light. This light emanates from within the human, born from the heart of darkness and shadows. The Horia light is not just a symbol of consciousness but also of deep connection to nature, others, and the very meaning of existence. This light is called “hidden light” in poetic language, revealed in moments of silence and meditation.</p>

<h2>3. Freedom, Choice, and Responsibility</h2>

<h3>3.1. Freedom in the Teachings of Zoroaster</h3>
<p>Zoroaster emphasizes human freedom to choose between the path of good and that of evil. Humans are free to choose the way of Asha (truth) or that of Druj (falsehood). This freedom is conditioned by responsibility, as a wrong choice leads to moral and cosmic consequences. The Gathas affirm that conscious and wise choice is the pillar of life.</p>

<h3>3.2. Freedom in the Horia Religion</h3>
<p>Horia understands freedom as a restoration of broken bonds and a return to the “true self.” This freedom is not only liberation from external constraints but also transcendence of internal cultural and mental conditioning. Horia highlights the responsibility that freedom implies, a commitment to preserving balance and coexistence.</p>

<h2>4. Nature: Coexistence and Sacredness</h2>

<h3>4.1. Nature in the Teachings of Zoroaster</h3>
<p>Nature is sacred in Zoroastrianism. Fire, water, earth, and air are sacred elements that maintain the purity and order of the world. Respect for these elements and the preservation of natural order are essential aspects of the religion. Zoroastrian teachings call for environmental protection as part of Asha.</p>

<h3>4.2. Nature in the Horia Religion</h3>
<p>Horia regards nature not only as sacred but as an integral part of human existence. The human body and nature are inseparably linked, and destroying nature is equivalent to destroying oneself. Respect for nature in this faith is respect for life, coexistence, and a future where humans and nature are intertwined.</p>

<h2>5. Evil, Falsehood, and Rupture</h2>

<h3>5.1. The Concept of Evil in the Teachings of Zoroaster</h3>
<p>Evil is defined in Zoroastrian thought by Ahriman and falsehood. Ahriman symbolizes destruction, rupture, and chaos, absolutely opposed to Asha. Evil is an independent essence that must be fought by the power of good.</p>

<h3>5.2. Evil in the Horia Religion</h3>
<p>In Horia, evil is not an independent essence but a rupture of bonds and loss of harmony. Evil is seen as a state of separation and discontinuity from light and coexistence, and is healed by restoring bonds and awareness.</p>

<h2>6. The Body, the Woman, and Incarnation</h2>

<h3>6.1. Zoroaster’s View of Woman and Body</h3>
<p>Zoroaster considers the woman as possessing a soul and an equal place with man. The Gathas clearly affirm that women have the right to choice and responsibility. Although patriarchal ideas appeared in later texts, the original doctrine emphasizes the dignity of women and the purity of the body.</p>

<h3>6.2. The Horia View of Woman and Body</h3>
<p>In Horia, the body and woman are sacred, symbolizing gentleness, beauty, and the manifestation of light in the material world. The body is not just a tool of life but a temple of the soul, and the woman is an incarnation of creativity and coexistence. This religion emphasizes deep respect for the body and feminine energy.</p>

<h2>7. Time, Salvation, and the Future</h2>

<h3>7.1. The Concept of Time in Zoroaster’s Teachings</h3>
<p>Zoroastrianism has a linear view of time. Time progresses toward a final point called “Soshyant,” where salvation and the final victory of good will be realized. This perspective is both hopeful and definitive.</p>

<h3>7.2. The Concept of Time in the Horia Religion</h3>
<p>Horia sees time as cyclical, where salvation occurs in the present, in a moment of awakening and connection to lost bonds. The future is less determined and more fluid and becoming.</p>

<h2>8. Language, Myth, and Poetic Truth</h2>

<h3>8.1. Language and Myth in Zoroaster’s Teachings</h3>
<p>Zoroaster’s texts are poetic and symbolic. Old Iranian conveys metaphysical truths in the form of myths and chants. These texts must be interpreted rigorously to understand the hidden truth beneath the images.</p>

<h3>8.2. Language and Poetry in the Horia Religion</h3>
<p>Horia places central importance on poetry as a mode of spiritual expression. Language is a bridge between inner light and the outer world. Truth is experienced as a poetic and sensitive experience.</p>

<h2>9. Conclusion</h2>
<p>Despite their temporal and cultural differences, the teachings of Zoroaster and the Horia religion share a profound vision of light as truth and purity, freedom as responsibility, and nature as a sacred sanctuary. Dialogue between these two systems can inspire a renewed spirituality centered on coexistence, respect, and peace.</p>

<p>This comparative analysis shows that the search for an inner light, the importance of moral choice, and harmony with nature transcend epochs and cultures, offering a universal path for humanity today.</p>
