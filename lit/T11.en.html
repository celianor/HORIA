<h1>Jesus the Horyanist: Reinterpreting Christ‚Äôs Teachings through Horianism ‚Äì Part 2</h1>

<h2>4. The Kingdom of God is Within You: An Inner Theology</h2>
<p>
Christ did not only call for faith but for recognition. His famous phrase to the Pharisees:  
</p>
<blockquote>
‚ÄúThe kingdom of God does not come with observation... for the kingdom of God is within you.‚Äù (Luke 17:21)
</blockquote>
<p>
This teaching, contrary to the common idea of heaven as a place beyond death, offers an inward and ontological view.  
In horianism, it is also said:  
</p>
<blockquote>
‚ÄúIn you is placed a lamp that no wind can extinguish unless you blow on it yourself.‚Äù
</blockquote>
<p>
From this perspective, every human being carries the kingdom within, provided they awaken from forgetfulness.
</p>

<h2>5. The Bread and the Wine: A Rite to Remember the Divine Presence in Man</h2>
<p>
During the Eucharist, Jesus gives the bread as a sign of his body, and the wine as a sign of his blood to his disciples:  
</p>
<blockquote>
‚ÄúThis is my body... this is my blood... do this in remembrance of me.‚Äù (Luke 22:19‚Äì20)
</blockquote>
<p>
If this is seen not simply as a symbol of sacrifice but as a sign of the union of man with the divine presence,  
this rite can be understood as a reminder that:  
</p>
<blockquote>
Horianism is within us. The bread, the wine, the gaze, the touch, the fellowship‚Äîall are manifestations of this presence.
</blockquote>

<h2>6. Death and Resurrection: Passing from Shadow to Light</h2>
<p>
In Christianity, the death of Jesus on the cross is interpreted as a sacrifice for the sins of humanity.  
But it can also be seen differently: Jesus stood in love until the end, even praying for his enemies:  
</p>
<blockquote>
‚ÄúFather, forgive them, for they know not what they do.‚Äù (Luke 23:34)
</blockquote>
<p>
From the horianist perspective, this moment is the peak of horyanist awareness:  
Choosing light in the darkest moment.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion: Christ, the Conscious Mirror of Horianism</h2>
<p>
In traditional Christian theology, Christ is the Son of God and the Savior, and his purpose is redemption.  
In the horyanist reading, he is a man aware of his horyanism, whose goal is to awaken other mirrors.
</p>
<p>
If Christianity views God as Father and Judge, and man as sinner needing grace,  
horianism sees God as the love within man, and man as the silent mirror of horianism.
</p>
<p>
From the horianist viewpoint, Christ is an example of a man who discovered his ‚Äúinner light‚Äù and lived it with love.  
He transformed a dominating monotheism into an accompanying monotheism. His message was not exclusivity in divine sonship,  
but a call to recognize universal sonship.
