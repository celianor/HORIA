  <h1>Chapter 6: Conclusion – Religion as the Natural Order of the Human Soul</h1>

  <p>After analyzing the religions of Horia, Islam, Christianity, and Buddhism based on Aristotle’s four causes (material, formal, efficient, and final), we must now ask:</p>
  <p>From Aristotle’s perspective, which religious form leads to the best order for the human soul and society?</p>
  <p>Aristotle is neither a prophet nor a messenger but a wise observer. He evaluates religion by the standards of reason, virtue, and natural purpose.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>6.1. Religion, if it is natural…</h2>
  <p>If religion is not born from fear or a tool of power, but a natural response to the natural needs of the human soul, it must be:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Made from real, human elements: suffering, compassion, wisdom</li>
    <li>Have a clear, beautiful, and rational form: open to critique, dialogue, without deceptive ambiguity</li>
    <li>Practiced by wise and virtuous people, not absolute intermediaries or earthly rulers</li>
    <li>And its purpose should be the flourishing of humans, society, and life in this world and the next</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If such a religion can exist, it would be a natural, civil, and ethical religion.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>6.2. Horia: The religion closest to Aristotle’s civil ideal</h2>
  <p>Based on these criteria, the religion of Horia excels in several aspects:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Its material is the shared suffering of humans and collective wisdom, not myth or glorification of fear</li>
    <li>Its form is clear, compassionate, and amendable; lacking deceptive mysteries</li>
    <li>Its agents are ordinary but awakened and virtuous people, not supernatural prophets or religious rulers</li>
    <li>Its final purpose is ethical living in this world, physical hope in the afterlife, and building a kind world for all</li>
  </ul>
  <p>From Aristotle’s view, this religion, as a human-ethical phenomenon, is the closest to the “good city” and “rational life.”</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>6.3. Aristotle’s proposal: From servitude to dialogue</h2>
  <p>If Aristotle were to prescribe a religion, it would be like this:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A religion without a prophet, but with a clear message</li>
    <li>A religion without miracles, but with daily kindness</li>
    <li>A religion without exclusivity, but with free dialogue</li>
    <li>A religion without fear of hell, but with passion for compassion</li>
    <li>A religion without greed for paradise, but with faith in the beauty of life</li>
  </ul>
  <p>And these are exactly the features that Horia has—not as a miraculous religion, but as a superior and rational form of religion in an age where ancient and traditional religions show many faults and fail to create happiness for suffering people through the deception of heaven and hell.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>6.4. Final word: Religion, if faithful to the beauty of the soul…</h2>
  <p>Aristotle writes:</p>
  <blockquote>
    The goal of philosophy is a good life; and if a religion aids the good life, it has remained true to itself.
  </blockquote>
  <p>So, if religion is what the soul demands—not fear, not domination, not myth—but beauty, wisdom, and love for humanity, then religion will not be the enemy of philosophy but its complement.</p>
  <p>The Horia faith, with all its potential strengths, is a step on this path.</p>
