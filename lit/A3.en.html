  <h1>Outer Revolution, Inner Revolution</h1>
  <h2>From the French Revolution's Threefold Motto to Horia‚Äôs</h2>

  <p>History is not impatient. It holds within itself the muffled cries of suffering for centuries‚Äîuntil one day they erupt into screams.</p>

  <p>Then, in the streets and squares, in books and on people‚Äôs lips, words are born‚Äîwords that cannot be undone.</p>

  <p>The French Revolution was one of those moments.  
  Horia is another.</p>

  <p>One rose in the 18th century to break the chains of monarchy and church.  
  The other rises in the 21st century from within the soul, to shatter the chains of hollow meaning.</p>

  <p><strong>One sought to make subjects into citizens.  
  The other seeks to make citizens fully human again.</strong></p>

  <h2>Why did France revolt?</h2>

  <p>Before 1789, French society was sharply divided:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>An absolute monarchy hoarded all power.</li>
    <li>The Catholic Church monopolized not just faith, but thought.</li>
    <li>The nobility paid no taxes, while the poor bore the burden.</li>
    <li>The Enlightenment philosophers called for liberty and human rights.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Bread was scarce. Thought was forbidden.  
  The people finally rose.  
  Blood was shed, crowns fell, churches stepped back‚Äîand the world watched.</p>

  <h2>The Gains of the French Revolution</h2>

  <p>Three words became beacons of a new era:</p>
  <blockquote>
    Liberty, Equality, Fraternity.
  </blockquote>

  <p>Yet these gains, powerful as they were, remained in one domain: <strong>the external world of humanity.</strong></p>

  <h2>And the inner world? Still silent</h2>

  <p>The modern human is free, but lost in freedom.  
  Equal, but uncertain of self.  
  In society, seeking brotherhood‚Äîyet inwardly alone.</p>

  <h2>Horia: A Revolution in the Realm of Meaning</h2>

  <p>Horia is an answer to the inner silence.</p>

  <p>Three words form its foundation:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Freedom:</strong> liberation from fear, imposed meanings, and psychological bondage.</li>
    <li><strong>Dignity:</strong> responsibility, awakened conscience, self-forged worth.</li>
    <li><strong>Light:</strong> understanding, kindness, dialogue, meaning.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion: From Subject to Citizen, From Citizen to Human</h2>

  <blockquote>
    The French Revolution made subjects into citizens.  
    Horia seeks to make citizens fully human.
  </blockquote>

  <p>France shattered external domination.  
  Horia confronts internal domination.</p>

  <p>The one wrote laws.  
  The other seeks new meaning.</p>
