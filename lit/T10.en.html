<h1>Jesus the Horian: Reinterpreting Christ’s Teachings from the Perspective of Horia - Part 1 </h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
This article offers a comparative reading between the figure and message of Jesus Christ and the teachings of the Horia tradition. Within this framework, Jesus is not merely a prophet or savior, but a Horian—conscious of the source of inner light within himself and others. His actions and words, such as washing the disciples’ feet or proclaiming “the Kingdom of God is within you,” are manifestations of this awareness. Through a rereading of the New Testament, we suggest that Jesus was not only the “Son of God” but a mirror of the Horian truth of humanity, whose mission was to awaken other mirrors.
</p>

<h2>Introduction: Jesus through the Lens of Horia</h2>
<p>
In Horia, the human being is not a sinner by nature, but a manifestation of Hura—the creative and loving essence of existence. One of the foundational teachings of Horia is that every person, upon awakening, can become a mirror of Hura. From this viewpoint, Jesus was someone who had attained this awareness, and thus his life, words, and crucifixion all served as reminders of this forgotten station to others.
</p>
<p>
Christian texts refer to Jesus as the Son of God. But if we interpret this not as superiority over others, but as his awareness of the divine nature within humanity, we might say:
</p>
<blockquote>
Jesus was someone who consciously saw the reflection of Hura within himself, and came to invite others to look within.
</blockquote>

<h2>1. A Father, Not a Ruler: Transforming the Notion of God</h2>
<p>
Jesus calls God “Father”—a revolutionary term in the Judaic world where God was mostly seen as King and Judge. In the Lord’s Prayer, he says:
</p>
<blockquote>
“Our Father in heaven…” (Matthew 6:9)
</blockquote>
<p>
This address not only signals intimacy, but reflects an ontological foundation: God is a loving source from whom human beings emerge.
</p>
<p>
The same idea is present in the “First Call” of Horia:
</p>
<blockquote>
“I am the One—neither born nor created... I summoned you from a hidden radiance in the boundless womb of being…”
</blockquote>
<p>
In both narratives, the origin of being is love—not domination.
</p>

<h2>2. Christ’s Awareness of the Divine Station of Humans</h2>
<p>
There is evidence in the New Testament that Jesus was aware that humans, like himself, come from God:
</p>
<blockquote>
“Is it not written in your Law, ‘I said, you are gods’?” (John 10:34)
</blockquote>
<p>
He cites this Psalm verse in defense against the accusation of blasphemy when he calls himself the Son of God. This may reflect his awareness that humans—at their core—are divine.
</p>
<blockquote>
In Horia, it is said: “O child of light and motion... you too, O child of possibility, carry a hidden world within.”
</blockquote>
<p>
This raises the question: Why didn’t Jesus explicitly call others sons and daughters of God as he did himself?
</p>
<p>
In John 20:17, he tells Mary Magdalene:
</p>
<blockquote>
“I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.”
</blockquote>
<p>
This verse may testify to his awareness of a shared divine station with others—though he didn’t always express it overtly, perhaps due to historical context or the audience’s understanding.
</p>
<p>
In Horia’s view, all humans are manifestations of Hura—and Christ was one who saw and embodied that truth.
</p>

<h2>3. The Last Supper: Foot Washing as Recognition of Divine Humanity</h2>
<p>
One of the clearest moments of Horian consciousness in Jesus’ life is the foot-washing at the Last Supper (John 13:5–17). He washes not only the feet of Peter and John, but also those of Judas, who would betray him.
</p>
<p>
Christian texts interpret this act as an example of humility. But from the Horian perspective, it could be interpreted as:
</p>
<blockquote>
In this moment, Jesus honors the essence of humanity: even the betrayer is a part of Hura.
</blockquote>
<p>
As the First Call says:
</p>
<blockquote>
“And as the kindest friend, I become a lamp for you… I summoned you not as a land to conquer, but as a friend to converse with.”
</blockquote>
