<h1>Jesus the Horian: A Rereading of Christ's Teachings from the Perspective of Horia - Part 1</h1>

<h2>4. The Kingdom of God Is Within You: Inner Theology</h2>
<p>
Jesus did not only call for faith, but for recognition. His famous words to the Pharisees:
</p>
<blockquote>
"The kingdom of God does not come with observation... For indeed, the kingdom of God is within you." (Luke 17:21)
</blockquote>
<p>
This teaching, contrary to the common image of heaven as a place beyond death, offers an inner and ontological view. In Horia we also read:
</p>
<blockquote>
"I have placed within you a lamp that no wind can extinguish‚Äîunless you blow it out yourself."
</blockquote>
<p>
From this perspective, every human carries the kingdom‚Äîif only they awaken from negligence.
</p>

<h2>5. Bread and Wine: A Ritual of Remembering Divine Presence in Humanity</h2>
<p>
During the Eucharist, Jesus gives bread as his body and wine as his blood:
</p>
<blockquote>
"This is my body... This is my blood... Do this in remembrance of me." (Luke 22:19‚Äì20)
</blockquote>
<p>
If we interpret this not as a symbol of sacrifice but of union between the human and the divine, it becomes a ritual that reminds us:
</p>
<blockquote>
Hora is within us. Bread, wine, a glance, a touch, companionship‚Äîall are its expressions.
</blockquote>

<h2>6. Death and Resurrection: Crossing from Shadow to Light</h2>
<p>
In Christianity, Jesus' death on the cross is seen as a sacrifice for humanity‚Äôs sins. But it can also be seen differently: Jesus stood with love until the last moment, even praying for his enemies:
</p>
<blockquote>
"Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing." (Luke 23:34)
</blockquote>
<p>
In Horia's view, this is the pinnacle of Horian awareness:
</p>
<blockquote>
To choose light in the darkest hour.
</blockquote>

<h2>Conclusion: Christ as the Aware Mirror of Hora</h2>
<p>
In traditional Christian theology, Jesus is the Son of God and the Savior whose mission is redemption. In the Horian reading, he is a human who has become aware of his inner Hora, and his mission is to awaken other mirrors. If Christianity sees God as Father and Judge, and humanity as sinful and in need of grace, in Horia, God is the compassion within, and humans are the silent mirrors of Hora.
</p>
<p>
From Horia's point of view, Christ is a model of a person who discovered their luminous self and lived it with love. His message turned oppressive monotheism into an accompanying monotheism. His call was not exclusivity in sonship but a universal invitation to rediscover the divine heritage of all.
