  <h1>Thirteenth Assembly: On Empathy and the Unity of Hearts</h1>

  <p>One among the gathering rose, his voice mingled with wonder and longing:<br>
  “O Horia,<br>
  in a world woven from countless differences—<br>
  of wounds, tongues, dreams, and beliefs—<br>
  what force can draw hearts near again?<br>
  Amid such distance, how might love blossom anew?”</p>

  <p>And Horia, with a gentle smile<br>
  and a voice like a soft breeze over still waters, replied:</p>

  <p>O seeker of tenderness,<br>
  empathy is a hidden and subtle force<br>
  that threads hearts together—<br>
  not by the bonds of speech,<br>
  but by the quiet thread of understanding.</p>

  <p>Empathy is that rare and sacred moment<br>
  when you step out of your own skin<br>
  and breathe, for a time, within the soul of another.<br>
  It is seeing the world not as it appears to you,<br>
  but as it is felt by someone else.</p>

  <p>Empathy is a silent dialogue between hearts,<br>
  unburdened by logic,<br>
  free from the need to prove.<br>
  It is a drop of light<br>
  falling into the shadows of judgment,<br>
  weaving distant paths into one shared road.</p>

  <p>Where empathy settles,<br>
  pride quietly dissolves,<br>
  and hostility melts like mist in the morning sun.<br>
  Languages—though foreign—<br>
  become one through the softness of shared intention.</p>

  <p>Empathy is the beginning of true friendship—<br>
  not the shallow kind of smiles and greetings,<br>
  but a bond rooted deep in the soil of the soul,<br>
  nourished by the rain of compassion and understanding.</p>

  <p>Know this, fellow traveler:<br>
  until you see the other as a mirror of yourself,<br>
  love will not find its way to your heart.<br>
  And until you listen with your soul<br>
  to a pain you've never tasted,<br>
  you will know only the name of empathy,<br>
  not its meaning.</p>

  <p>And empathy is the root of unity—<br>
  not a unity of surface,<br>
  but one of spirit,<br>
  where “I” and “you” dissolve into “we,”<br>
  and the human soul walks no longer alone.</p>

  <hr>

  <blockquote>
    Empathy<br>
    is a bridge between hearts,<br>
    not for conquest, but for connection.<br>
    The empathic one<br>
    finds themselves in the eyes of the other,<br>
    and sees the world<br>
    not only through their own sight,<br>
    but through the quiet window<br>
    of another’s heart.
