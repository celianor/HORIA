  <h1>Assembly IV: On the Mystery of Creation and the Why of Existence</h1>

  <p>One who looked up to the heavens and listened deep within asked:</p>

  <p>“Where did we come from?<br>
  Why did this world come to be?<br>
  Was everything born of blind chance?<br>
  Or was there a design behind it?”</p>

  <p>If there is a Creator,<br>
  why is He silent?<br>
  Why does He not reveal to us the secret of being?”</p>

  <p>Horia replied,<br>
  not with harsh judgment,<br>
  but with gentle thought<br>
  and the warmth of longing that embraces even doubt:</p>

  <p>O seeker of truth,<br>
  you are not alone.<br>
  All awakened hearts<br>
  have opened their eyes with this same first question.</p>

  <p>In Horia,<br>
  no one says:<br>
  “God created the world in six days,”<br>
  nor says:<br>
  “No hand was present in the making of the universe.”</p>

  <p>In the words of Horia:<br>
  The world is the song of God.<br>
  Not whispered secretly to self-proclaimed prophets,<br>
  but echoed in every tree and star,<br>
  every atom and every heart.</p>

  <p>The universe is not a blind accident;<br>
  there is order in it,<br>
  beauty,<br>
  growth and transformation,<br>
  a movement from simplicity to awareness,<br>
  from rawness to understanding,<br>
  from namelessness to the desire for meaning.</p>

  <p>If you ask:<br>
  “Why did He not create us complete and without need? Why so flawed and fragile?”<br>
  Horia whispers:<br>
  Because it is in the becoming that greatness lies.<br>
  If the beginning were already the end,<br>
  what joy would there be in climbing?<br>
  Where would be the delight of finding after the search?<br>
  What would hope for knowledge mean, if all were already known?</p>

  <p>In Horia’s view,<br>
  God painted a living canvas—beautiful, yet dynamic and seeking perfection,<br>
  like a loving gardener,<br>
  who planted a seed of goodness in the heart of the world,<br>
  and gave it room to grow,<br>
  and along the way, to create itself.</p>

  <p>And we too,<br>
  are a branch of that same seed,<br>
  rising,<br>
  longing for light.</p>

  <p>In Horia,<br>
  creation is not a battlefield of good and evil,<br>
  nor a test for judgment,<br>
  but a dialogue between hidden light and yearning souls, questioning hearts.</p>

  <div class="divider">⸻</div>

  <p><strong>And in the teaching of Horia:</strong></p>

  <p>The world is a path toward meaning, not a prison of pain.<br>
  God is a tender inviter, not a commanding tyrant.<br>
  And creation,<br>
  a chance to recognize and recreate love<br>
  in the depths of one’s own heart.</p>
