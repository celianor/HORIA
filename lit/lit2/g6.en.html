  <h1>Assembly VI: On Death, Liberation, and the Soul’s Destiny</h1>

  <p>One of the attendants,<br>
  with a noble sorrow in his eyes,<br>
  gently asked:</p>

  <p>“Is death an end or a passage?<br>
  Is there a soul that endures,<br>
  or does all fall silent<br>
  when the body returns to the earth?<br>
  And if there is a soul,<br>
  what is its fate?<br>
  What is liberation?<br>
  And is it something to hope for?”</p>

  <p>Horia spoke,<br>
  not offering easy promises,<br>
  but out of love for humanity’s honest unknowing:</p>

  <p>Companion,<br>
  in the depths of the heart,<br>
  a light of hope shines,<br>
  for such love,<br>
  such thought and devotion,<br>
  do not vanish into the soil.</p>

  <p>In our path,<br>
  death is not a wall;<br>
  it is a gate.<br>
  Not an end,<br>
  but the opening of another chapter of being.</p>

  <p>You are a drop<br>
  that rose from the ocean,<br>
  and you will return to it.<br>
  Not to be lost,<br>
  but to embrace the whole sea within you.</p>

  <p>Your body is made of dust<br>
  born from a dying star,<br>
  and in your soul<br>
  echo songs<br>
  that are not only of this earth.</p>

  <p>In our eyes,<br>
  death is not the punishment of life,<br>
  but a passing through an old skin<br>
  into the unseen mysteries of the soul.</p>

  <p>If you ask:<br>
  “Is there a heaven and a hell?”<br>
  We say:<br>
  heaven and hell begin here,<br>
  and from within us.<br>
  Hell is a dark heart<br>
  kindled by hatred.<br>
  And heaven<br>
  is a lamp lit by love.</p>

  <p>Those who,<br>
  in their lives,<br>
  brought light to others’ souls,<br>
  have taken a step toward liberation<br>
  even before death.</p>

  <p>In Horia,<br>
  liberation is not the reward of worship,<br>
  but the fruit of awakening.<br>
  Not a bargain with the sky,<br>
  but a blooming from within.</p>

  <p>If the soul blends with love,<br>
  it will escape the body’s cage like a fragrance,<br>
  and return to the source<br>
  where the first song of being rose.</p>

  <div class="divider">⸻</div>

  <p><strong>And in the way of the good:</strong><br>
  Death is not silence;<br>
  it is liberation.<br>
  And liberation belongs to those<br>
  who have lived love,<br>
  not merely praised its name.</p>
