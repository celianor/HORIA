  <h2>Session Seventeen: In the Silence and Depth of Stillness</h2>

  <p>Someone quietly asked, with a tender voice:</p>

  <blockquote>
    "Why does the heart sometimes stop speaking?<br />
    And why is there in silence something that a thousand words cannot hold?"
  </blockquote>

  <p>Horia answered, calmly and without rush,<br />
  as if silence itself was a word spoken:</p>

  <p>Silence, yes,<br />
  is not the failure of speech,<br />
  but the opening of a gate to the meaning beyond words.</p>

  <p>In a world filled with noise and endless words,<br />
  the soul grows weary of constant sound,<br />
  and longs<br />
  to listen without noise,<br />
  to understand without utterance.</p>

  <p>Silence is not a cold loneliness,<br />
  but a warm and tender refuge;<br />
  a presence full of life;<br />
  a place where the soul<br />
  converses with Being<br />
  without opening lips,<br />
  without uttering a word.</p>

  <p>In Horia,<br />
  silence is the soil where meanings sprout;<br />
  an open field for hidden mysteries;<br />
  and whoever befriends silence<br />
  dwells with a pure truth.</p>

  <p>How many voices are heard only in silence,<br />
  how many melodies, lost in the turmoil of words,<br />
  sing like nightingales at dawn<br />
  in silent hearts...</p>

  <hr />

  <p><strong>And in our tradition, it is thus:</strong></p>

  <blockquote>
    Silence<br />
    is another language of presence;<br />
    those who listen within themselves<br />
    will see the world with new eyes.<br />
    Silence is not a void,<br />
    but an open embrace of Being,<br />
    where the soul finds peace and light.
