  <h1>Session Nine: The Infinite Secret of Love</h1>

  <p>One of the companions,<br>
  whose soul brimmed with longing and eyes with questions,<br>
  asked:</p>

  <blockquote>
    “What is love?<br>
    Where does this restless heartbeat come from?<br>
    Is love only between man and woman?<br>
    Or is it a hidden, radiant path toward God?<br>
    And how can it be known?”
  </blockquote>

  <p>Horia replied,<br>
  gently, in a voice that rose from the spring of the soul:</p>

  <p>O awakened heart,<br>
  love is neither chain nor wall,<br>
  but a free bird,<br>
  soaring through the boundless sky of the soul.</p>

  <p>Love is a light that shines even in the deepest night,<br>
  a lamp for weary hearts,<br>
  a cool drink for the thirsty soul.</p>

  <p>It exists between woman and man, yes,<br>
  between two human beings, yes,<br>
  but it flows beyond:<br>
  in a child's smile,<br>
  in a mother’s gaze,<br>
  in the wind brushing golden fields,<br>
  and in a silence that understands without words.</p>

  <p>Love is the language of mysteries,<br>
  where words fall short,<br>
  and the heart speaks in silence.</p>

  <p>Love is the river<br>
  that rushes, eagerly,<br>
  toward the ocean of being—<br>
  toward God,<br>
  toward the origin of the self.</p>

  <p>To love is to open one’s arms without condition;<br>
  to love without asking why.<br>
  It is to feel another’s wound as your own,<br>
  and their joy as your own joy.</p>

  <p>Love is freedom,<br>
  openness,<br>
  and the world reborn—<br>
  in a glance,<br>
  in the beat of a heart.</p>

  <p>Love is a heart beating for another heart;<br>
  and that beat,<br>
  is the memory of return—<br>
  return to its origin,<br>
  to that first light<br>
  once called *Horia* within us,<br>
  from whom we were parted...</p>

  <hr>

  <blockquote>
    Love,<br>
    is a bird set free,<br>
    a light in the night,<br>
    a path toward God.<br>
    Love is the tongue of mystery,<br>
    and an embrace for all that exists.
