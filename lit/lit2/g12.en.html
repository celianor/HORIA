  <h1>Twelfth Assembly: On Wisdom and the Light of the Heart</h1>

  <p>O kind companion and fellow traveler,<br>
  Wisdom is not merely dry and cold knowledge,<br>
  nor just a collection of words written on ancient pages—<br>
  but a heavenly light born deep within the heart,<br>
  a sun that rises in the soul’s chest,<br>
  dispelling the shadows of fear and ignorance.</p>

  <p>Wisdom is listening to the voiceless whispers of the soul,<br>
  hearing those soft melodies that reason often fails to grasp;<br>
  it is a gaze that sees beyond the surface of things,<br>
  opening the eye of the heart to behold the unseen threads that bind all things together—<br>
  threads flowing like blood through the living body of existence,<br>
  weaving everything into a single, endless tapestry.</p>

  <p>Wisdom is a lamp that glows in the darkest nights of life,<br>
  illuminating the path of a lost soul,<br>
  unfastening, one by one, the chains of confusion and ignorance,<br>
  guiding our trembling steps toward clarity and peace.</p>

  <p>Wisdom teaches us that no one is complete,<br>
  each of us is both a teacher and a student<br>
  in the boundless classroom of being.<br>
  Through dialogue—through this exchange of light and thought—<br>
  new windows of knowledge and kindness are opened,<br>
  and thirsty spirits are gently refreshed.</p>

  <p>How beautiful it is to know that on this radiant path,<br>
  hearts and minds, like two distant rivers, merge together—<br>
  and every spark that shines in our hearts<br>
  becomes a torch lighting life’s road ever more brightly,<br>
  so that even in the world’s darkness, a shadow of hope might appear.</p>

  <p>Wisdom goes beyond understanding and learning;<br>
  it is a still and glowing state of the heart,<br>
  a voiceless song, a melody winding through the core of being.<br>
  Listen to the music of existence:<br>
  in that sacred silence, you will hear the voice of wisdom,<br>
  calling you toward peace, serenity, and self-knowing.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>And thus is wisdom in our way:</p>

  <p>Wisdom<br>
  is a timeless light in awakened hearts,<br>
  a lamp shining upon the path of life,<br>
  a sacred and sturdy bridge<br>
  between hearts and thoughts—<br>
  lifting us from the dark of ignorance to the clarity of awareness,<br>
  teaching us that love and knowledge<br>
  are the two wings of the soul<br>
  flying toward the Infinite.</p>
