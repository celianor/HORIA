    <h1>Assembly Seven ‚Äì On Truth and the Diversity of Faiths</h1>

    <p>One of the seekers,<br>
    whose soul wandered lost among many creeds,<br>
    softly asked:</p>

    <p>‚ÄúIs there a single path to Truth?<br>
    Or does each faith glimpse it in its own light?<br>
    If both my religion and another teach compassion,<br>
    which one is more true?<br>
    And is a lie adorned in the name of faith<br>
    better than a truth that comes with no name or religion?‚Äù</p>

    <p>Horia,<br>
    who had not come to negate anyone,<br>
    but to kindle a lantern within,<br>
    replied thus:</p>

    <p>O questioner,<br>
    Truth is not a narrow stream<br>
    that flows in only one bed;<br>
    it is the sun<br>
    to which a thousand windows open.</p>

    <p>If you drink from one spring,<br>
    and another from a different one,<br>
    are you not both quenched?<br>
    Does your thirst<br>
    crave the name of the spring,<br>
    or the clarity of the water?</p>

    <p>We, in Horia, do not say:<br>
    only our path is right.<br>
    We say:<br>
    any path that leads one to love,<br>
    to light,<br>
    and to liberation,<br>
    is precious.</p>

    <p>But...</p>

    <p>Not every road that resembles truth<br>
    leads to it.</p>

    <p>A faith that teaches violence,<br>
    even in the name of God,<br>
    stands far from the light.</p>

    <p>A creed that belittles women,<br>
    frightens children from joy,<br>
    condemns the lover as sinful,<br>
    or binds its followers<br>
    under the sword of apostasy‚Äî<br>
    though a thousand verses in it may ring true,<br>
    it dries the heart;<br>
    just as a criminal may have many good traits,<br>
    but a soul void of love.</p>

    <p>In our path,<br>
    truth lives in clarity.<br>
    And every belief<br>
    that calls the human being<br>
    to freedom,<br>
    to kindness,<br>
    and to growth,<br>
    is no stranger‚Äî<br>
    whatever its name may be.</p>

    <p>We are not here to erase,<br>
    nor to rule.<br>
    We are here for dialogue,<br>
    for the fellowship of hearts,<br>
    and to see truth not as possession,<br>
    but as radiance.</p>

    <blockquote>
      And this is the seventh lantern in our way:<br><br>
      Truth is no wall;<br>
      it is the sun.<br>
      There are many paths,<br>
      but not all lead to the light.<br>
      And that path is true<br>
      which awakens the soul<br>
      to love and to freedom.
    </blockquote>
