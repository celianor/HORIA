  <h1>Assembly II: On Humanity, Freedom, and Error</h1>

  <p>Someone asked:<br>
  “If man was created free,<br>
  why does he fall so often?<br>
  Why does he tend toward evil?<br>
  And if fault is his,<br>
  does he deserve eternal punishment?”</p>

  <p>Horia replied,<br>
  not with the voice of a judge,<br>
  but like a friend seated beside him,<br>
  laying a hand on his shoulder:</p>

  <p>O human,<br>
  freedom is a profound gift,<br>
  yet it is like a double-edged sword.<br>
  With it, one may light a lamp,<br>
  or wound a heart.</p>

  <p>In Horia,<br>
  human freedom is a sign of greatness,<br>
  not a proof of innocence.</p>

  <p>A human can think,<br>
  and in thinking,<br>
  they may err.</p>

  <p>But within that error<br>
  lies alchemy:<br>
  one can repent,<br>
  choose a new path,<br>
  and become better.</p>

  <p>Man is not innocent,<br>
  nor wicked,<br>
  but a being in-between,<br>
  striving to find himself<br>
  between light and shadow.</p>

  <p>If you ask:<br>
  “Should we burn forever for our faults?”<br>
  The answer is: no.<br>
  God is not vengeful.</p>

  <p>He does not burn his servants,<br>
  but watches in hope<br>
  that the servant, in the fire of remorse,<br>
  may forge something new from himself.</p>

  <p>In Horia,<br>
  sin is not the end of the road,<br>
  but a wound that, if tended,<br>
  may blossom.</p>

  <p>Horia believes:<br>
  the greatness of man is not in never falling,<br>
  but in rising after he has fallen;<br>
  and building from that stumble a bridge toward the light.</p>
