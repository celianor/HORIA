  <h1>Assembly V: On Law, Morality, and Conscience</h1>

  <p>Someone asked, with a heart seeking truth:</p>

  <p>“Why does religion need commandments?<br>
  If a person is good, do they need books and rules?<br>
  And if they act kindly out of fear of punishment, is that true kindness?<br>
  What is the purpose of religious law?<br>
  Does morality come from religion, or from the human heart?”</p>

  <p>Horia answered, not in the voice of judges,<br>
  but in the tone of friends:</p>

  <p>O companion,<br>
  many seek goodness not out of fear,<br>
  but through understanding love.</p>

  <p>If one feeds the hungry,<br>
  not out of fear of hell,<br>
  but because they have felt hunger themselves,<br>
  it is nobler than a thousand soulless prayers.</p>

  <p>In Horia,<br>
  goodness is not a command;<br>
  it is a mirror in which your soul sees itself.</p>

  <p>Law imposed by force<br>
  is a mask.<br>
  But when it wells up from within,<br>
  it becomes a lamp.</p>

  <p>Religion must awaken conscience,<br>
  not bind the people with reins.</p>

  <p>We do not believe the path should be marked by chains.<br>
  A lamp must be lit,<br>
  so that each person walks it freely,<br>
  moved by the desire of the soul.</p>

  <p>In Horia,<br>
  morality came before religion.<br>
  Before any prophet,<br>
  a mother cradled her child.<br>
  Before any verse,<br>
  a friend saved a heart from loneliness.</p>

  <p>This is the essence.</p>

  <p>A law that does not evolve with time<br>
  decays.<br>
  A religion that makes people fear love<br>
  is rule, not spirituality.</p>

  <div class="divider">⸻</div>

  <p><strong>And so it is in our tradition:</strong></p>

  <p>Goodness is not a command; it is a calling.<br>
  If religion does not awaken the conscience,<br>
  it is a tool of domination, not a path of liberation.<br>
  And law,<br>
  if not mixed with love and wisdom,<br>
  is a ritual without a soul.</p>
