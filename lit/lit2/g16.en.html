  <h2>Assembly 16: On the Play of Life and the Sacred Inner Child</h2>

  <p>One of the companions, who had walked for years through the alleys of the world wearing the heavy armor of seriousness, gently asked:</p>

  <blockquote>
    “O Horia, how should life be lived?<br>
    Should every moment be filled with gravity and effort, as though the weight of the world rests on our shoulders?<br>
    Or is there wisdom also in laughter and play?”
  </blockquote>

  <p>Horia smiled — light and free, like the breeze among flowering branches — and said:</p>

  <p>Life is a play; not a frivolous or careless game, but a sacred one, where every moment is a gateway to light, and every smile echoes the deepest wisdoms.</p>

  <p>The child within us is not mere simplicity, but a heart unmasked — fearless and pure.</p>

  <p>They see without judgment,<br>
  laugh without reason,<br>
  and forgive without expecting anything in return.</p>

  <p>Within that child lies a mystery, guarded by the truly wise: one who does not forget their inner child, even amid the storm of days, does not merely survive — they flourish.</p>

  <p>Know this:<br>
  Play is the wordless prayer of the child,<br>
  and laughter, their sacred chant.</p>

  <hr>

  <p><strong>And this is the "Nin" in our tradition:</strong></p>

  <blockquote>
    Life is a field of sacred play, not a battlefield for pride and conquest.<br>
    The child of the soul is not a distant memory, but a messenger of clarity.<br>
    Whoever embraces their childhood without shame draws close to the secret of freedom.
  </blockquote>
