    <h1>Eighth Assembly ‚Äì On Freedom, Choice, and the Bond with God</h1>

    <p>One of the attendees,<br>
    whose heart overflowed with a yearning for liberation, asked:</p>

    <p>‚ÄúAre we truly free?<br>
    Or is everything already written?<br>
    If God knows all, where is our free will?<br>
    Are we slaves or companions?<br>
    And how can we draw near to God without being chained?‚Äù</p>

    <p>Horia,<br>
    whose voice was gentle and full of grace,<br>
    answered:</p>

    <p>O seeker,<br>
    freedom is not merely a right granted to you;<br>
    it is the very light with which you were created.<br>
    Through the power of choice,<br>
    you have surpassed stone, plant, and star.</p>

    <p>If freedom were not within you,<br>
    then meaning, responsibility, and love would not exist.<br>
    And if you had no choice,<br>
    how could you love?<br>
    Love finds meaning only under the light of free will;<br>
    compulsion has no place in it.</p>

    <p>God<br>
    is not a king who casts you to Earth and watches,<br>
    but a companion who walks with you every step‚Äî<br>
    yet the path must be chosen by you.</p>

    <p>Do you know why all is not revealed to you?<br>
    Because God honors your freedom.<br>
    Instead of forcing you along a prewritten line,<br>
    He lays a blank page before you<br>
    and places the pen in your hand.</p>

    <p>Choice brings pain,<br>
    because it brings responsibility.<br>
    But through that pain,<br>
    you are transformed from a puppet into a creator.<br>
    Freedom is not escape from everything,<br>
    but the strength to stand between shadow and light,<br>
    and to choose what brightens your soul.</p>

    <p>And the bond with God<br>
    is not blind surrender,<br>
    nor degrading servitude;<br>
    it is a loving conversation<br>
    between two free souls.</p>

    <p>Whoever sees themselves as a powerless slave<br>
    has forged their own chains‚Äî<br>
    not God.</p>

    <p>And whoever walks consciously<br>
    in the path of love,<br>
    is in the embrace of the Friend;<br>
    not as a servant,<br>
    but as a beloved companion.</p>

    <blockquote>
      And in our path:<br><br>
      Freedom is the essence of the human soul,<br>
      choice is its flight,<br>
      and God is the Friend who, with tenderness,<br>
      takes our hand.<br>
      He who believes himself a slave has chained himself.<br>
      But he who sees God as a Friend is free‚Äîand can soar.
    </blockquote>
