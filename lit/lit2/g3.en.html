  <h1>Assembly III – On Doubt and Faith, and the Bond of Heart and Reason</h1>

  <p>One of the listeners, with eyes torn between belief and uncertainty, asked:</p>

  <p>“I want to believe,<br>
  but there is doubt in my heart.<br>
  I fear being deceived,<br>
  fear that my hope may be a mirage.<br>
  Is doubt a sign of disbelief?<br>
  Must faith be blind?<br>
  My reason says one thing,<br>
  my heart says another—<br>
  which should I follow?”</p>

  <p>Horia smiled,<br>
  not with judgment,<br>
  but with comfort for the soul:</p>

  <p>Seeker,</p>

  <p>Doubt is not the enemy of faith—<br>
  it is often its beginning.<br>
  Those who feel nothing do not question.<br>
  But your heart questions,<br>
  so it is alive, it is awake.</p>

  <p>In the path of Horia,<br>
  faith is not forced upon anyone;<br>
  it is born from the dialogue of heart and reason.</p>

  <p>We do not trust in faith born of fear,<br>
  nor in that which springs from stubbornness.</p>

  <p>The heart is a warm home,<br>
  but if its windows are left open,<br>
  the winds of illusion may chill it.<br>
  And reason is a lantern,<br>
  but on its own, sometimes the light is faint in the dark.</p>

  <p>Horia says:<br>
  let your heart and reason speak to one another.</p>

  <p>The heart tells you:<br>
  life longs for meaning—<br>
  friendship, truth, forgiveness, beauty—<br>
  these stir you for a reason.</p>

  <p>And reason says:<br>
  think, question, don’t be blind;<br>
  know your path, and don’t fear knowledge.</p>

  <p>Faith in Horia<br>
  is neither naive acceptance,<br>
  nor endless skepticism;<br>
  it is <strong>informed hope</strong>.</p>

  <p>You are like a lover who receives a letter,<br>
  not yet sure if it is truly from the beloved.<br>
  The heart whispers:<br>
  “This handwriting is theirs.”<br>
  And the mind replies:<br>
  “Let us check the address, seek the signs.”</p>

  <p>You neither cast the letter aside,<br>
  nor surrender blindly;<br>
  you walk forward—<br>
  guided by love and clarity.</p>

  <p><strong>This is the path of Horia.</strong></p>

  <hr style="margin: 3rem auto; border: none; border-top: 1px solid #ccc; width: 60%;">

  <p><strong>And in our way:</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Faith is enlightened hope.</strong><br>
  Not blind-eyed,<br>
  nor closed-hearted.<br>
  Neither hostile to reason,<br>
  nor enslaved by fear.</p>
