  <h1>Step One: On God and Man</h1>

  <p>One of the participants asked a question from the depths of their heart:</p>
  <p>“Is there a God?<br>
  And if there is, why does He allow suffering?<br>
  Why doesn’t He reveal Himself?<br>
  And if there isn’t, how does life find meaning?”</p>

  <p>And Horia,<br>
  not with the thunder of the heavens,<br>
  but with the softness of a light in the dark night,<br>
  answered thus:</p>

  <p>Seeker,<br>
  your question is not a sign of disbelief,<br>
  but a sign that your heart is awake<br>
  and your spirit has risen from the sleep of habit.</p>

  <p>In Horia,<br>
  God is not one who sits on a throne<br>
  and flips through the records of creation;<br>
  neither a whip-wielder,<br>
  nor an angry judge.</p>

  <p>We call God “Light”,<br>
  because through Him everything is seen,<br>
  yet He Himself escapes the eye;<br>
  not out of trickery,<br>
  but because His revealing<br>
  lies in the sight of goodness.</p>

  <p>If you ask:<br>
  “Why doesn’t He show Himself?”<br>
  we say:<br>
  He has shown Himself a thousand times,<br>
  in the tenderness of a mother who stays awake,<br>
  in a hand that binds a wound,<br>
  in eyes that grow more compassionate.</p>

  <p>He is the smile<br>
  that comes without reason to lighten another’s sorrow.</p>

  <p>In Horia,<br>
  God does not impose Himself;<br>
  He is like the sun:<br>
  He shines, whether you believe it or not.</p>

  <p>If you ask about suffering,<br>
  know that He does not create pain<br>
  to test or punish man.<br>
  The world flows by laws;<br>
  suffering comes from within that flow.<br>
  But He is with you,<br>
  in your endurance,<br>
  in hope that suddenly arises,<br>
  in the hand that rests on your shoulder.</p>

  <p>And if you ask:<br>
  “Can one live well without naming God?”<br>
  we say:<br>
  Yes, if goodness is sought from the heart,<br>
  not out of fear or reward.</p>

  <p>Because in Horia,<br>
  God is first truth, light, and kindness,<br>
  before being a name.</p>

  <p>Whoever walks this path,<br>
  whatever name they speak or keep silent,<br>
  walks in the light of God.</p>

  <div class="divider">⸻</div>

  <p>This is the foundation of faith in Horia:<br>
  not kneeling in fear,<br>
  but standing in truth.<br>
  Not worshipping a name,<br>
  but living in meaning.</p>
