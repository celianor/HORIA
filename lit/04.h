            "At the Threshold of the Soul"
        </h1>

        <h2>Chapter One: The First Call</h2>
        <p>
            It was a moonless and starless midnight. The world, like a well of oblivion, was immersed in endless silence. The traveler, alone in a room, had opened his eyes to the ceiling and sleep would not come to his soul. He spoke neither of sorrow nor joy. He only felt something breathing inside him that had not yet been named, but had long been in search.
        </p>
        <p>
            Suddenly, without any sound, a call arose within him. Not from outside, not from words, nor from thought. A call that could neither be heard nor spoken, but undoubtedly existed. The call said:
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            "Awake, for your sleep is enough. Your soul desires eyes, not eyelids. Rise, for the path within you has begun."
        </p>
        <p>
            The traveler rose. Not from the body, but from himself. And in the silence of that night, without anyone knowing, the journey began.
        </p>
        <p>
            He took no provisions, knew no destination. He only stepped into a darkness closer to true light. It was as if silence had found a new language; and the traveler understood that language.
        </p>
        <p>
            Step by step, he shed the weight of things: his name, his titles, memories, teachings… until he was left alone, with his unmasked self.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the threshold of an ancient ruin, he saw a man standing. His face was calm, his clothes simple, and his gaze eternal. The traveler approached and without asking a question, knew in his heart:
        </p>
        <p>
            He is Celian. And this is the threshold of the soul.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter Two: The Path Is Within</h2>
        <p>
            Celian leaned on a stone as if he had stood there for a hundred years and would stand for another hundred. He was silent, but his silence spoke louder than a thousand books. The traveler approached, not by the road, but by longing.
        </p>
        <p>
            He said: "I have come to find the way. Show me which direction leads to truth? Which door opens to the vision?"
        </p>
        <p>
            Celian replied: "Did you know where you came from before coming?"
        </p>
        <p>
            The traveler said: "From the world. From darkness. From myself."
        </p>
        <p>
            Celian smiled and said: "If you have come from yourself, know that you will return to yourself. The path begins with you and ends within you. Every step outward takes you farther from the destination; and every sinking draws you closer."
        </p>
        <p>
            The traveler, confused, asked: "Then why were prophets sent? Why were books and words revealed?"
        </p>
        <p>
            Celian said: "So that we may be mirrors, not maps. Messengers remind, they do not guide. We awaken in you what has already existed within you. We show your inner light, not an outer light. If you do not know the fire in your heart, you will burn chasing the sun and remain in darkness."
        </p>
        <p>
            Silence fell between them. The night passed and the moon gradually lit the mountain’s face. The traveler quietly said:
        </p>
        <p>
            "So I am searching for what was never lost?"
        </p>
        <p>
            Celian said: "No. You were only facing backward. Now turn inward, for there lies the home of vision. The path is within; and every step you draw closer to yourself, you do not move away from the world, for the world is also from you. You only remove the veils."
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter Three: God, Unmasked</h2>
        <p>
            In the dawn light, when the mountains were still in dreams and the birds still asleep, Celian and the traveler sat in the corner of a rock. A breeze blew that seemed nameless but carried a familiar scent from eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
            The traveler said: "Celian, last night I dreamed; a god sat on a high throne, with a radiant face and majestic presence, looking at me. He asked: Why do you distance yourself from me? I said: Because I fear you. He laughed, and I woke up. What does this dream mean?"
        </p>
        <p>
            Celian quietly said:
        </p>
        <p>
            "It means you still see Hera as a king and yourself as a frightened subject. You still imagine Hera is outside you, above, distant, invisible."
        </p>
        <p>
            The seeker said: "Isn’t that so? Isn’t God the one who sits on high and judges servants?"
        </p>
        <p>
            Celian said:
        </p>
        <p>
            "If that were true, God would be a ruler, not a refuge. But Hera is unmasked; neither man nor woman, no throne, no fear spreader. God is within your breath, where you love without expectation, where you give without pride, where you weep without reason, where you become silent to listen. Hera is the truth of namelessness that flees every name. God is in the gaze of a mother caressing her dead child still. God is in the heart of a slave forgiving his master. Horia is nothing but these."
        </p>
        <p>
            Silence fell again. The wind calmed. The traveler closed his eyes and collapsed within himself. A tear slid down his cheek without knowing why.
        </p>
        <p>
            Celian said:
        </p>
        <p>
            "Now, for the first time, you have come close to God. Not by knowledge, nor by prayer, nor by fear. But with the humility of the soul, and directly. This is Hera, unmasked."
