        <h2 id="letter1-title" style="margin:0 0 8px 0; font-size:18px;">Dear fellow seeker of the Light,</h2>

        <p>Your name is not written in my book, but in my heart, your footprints are clear; the steps of a human like me, wandering the alleys of the world in search of truth.</p>

        <p>I come from a land where church bells scatter the voice of faith in the wind; yet this voice was not always the voice of love. Sometimes, its melody was mixed with fear, sometimes with the command of kings and the sword.</p>

        <p>My faith is a river that starts from the mountains of the Gospel, but the sands of history have swallowed parts of its clarity. I still drink from it, but I know its water has not always remained pure.</p>

        <p>When I look at your faith, horia, a breeze touches my face; a breeze of freedom, reconciliation, and the renewed bond of human with earth, body, and soul.</p>

        <p>But I fear that this boundless plain, if left without gardeners, may one day be overrun with weeds. Borders, if turned into walls, suffocate the soul, but if turned into irrigation channels, they nourish the roots.</p>

        <p>Your freedom is beautiful, but freedom without a light in the moonless nights has robbers lurking.</p>

        <p>In my Christianity, the light is a living person: Christ. In Him, not only teachings, but a living presence exists, who knows the broken heart and touches the unseen wound.</p>

        <p>In horia, I see this light more in the hands of the community than in the face of a guide. Perhaps this is a strength; perhaps a danger. Because the collective conscience, if ever asleep, will leave the boat of truth rudderless.</p>

        <p>My friend, I seek neither to prove you wrong nor do you seek to deny me. We both know that truth belongs to no one.</p>

        <p>Our mission may only be this: to keep the fire of search alive, so our children, whether in churches or in the garden of horia, pursue the path with the same passion.</p>

        <p>A day will come when in every place of worship‚Äîwhether beneath golden domes or on rain-soaked grass‚Äîhumans will kneel not out of fear of judgment, nor for the pride of faith, but for the joy of loving.</p>

        <p style="margin-top:18px; font-weight:700; text-align:left;">With love and truth,<br>A Christian, seeker of the same light you pursue</p>

          <div class="tone"></div>
        </div>

        <div class="sep" aria-hidden="true"></div>

        <h2 id="letter2-title" style="margin:0 0 8px 0; font-size:18px;">Dear beloved friend in search of the Light,</h2>

        <p>I heard your letter like a distant bell‚Äôs sound; a voice that comes from a sincere heart, not from the megaphone of fanaticism.</p>

        <p>You rightly said that your faith has seen wounds through the centuries, and sometimes its hands were stained with deeds far from the spirit of Christ. But wherever I have seen an honest smile or a helping hand, I have sensed His fragrance, even if the church was silent.</p>

        <p>You called horia a boundless plain and feared weeds. Indeed, we need gardeners, but the gardener in horia is not a single person; it is every awakened heart that has risen from its heavy sleep. Our light does not belong to one face; because we believe that light shines in a thousand mirrors, and if one breaks, another reflects it.</p>

        <p>We rely on the collective conscience, but not on an unconscious crowd; rather on a gathering of living hearts that keep each other awake.</p>

        <p>You mentioned Christ as a light, and I say with all my heart: how fortunate the world is to have such a light. In our view, He is not only your light but one of the great lanterns on humanity‚Äôs path. We raise not one lantern but a thousand; not for dispersion, but so that if one goes out, the path remains bright.</p>

        <p>Truth, in our belief, is a river that flows from a thousand springs into one sea. You come from the mountains of the Gospel, and I from the plains of horia, but in the end, we both step into the same water.</p>

        <p>May it be that in every place of worship‚Äîbeneath the church bell or under nameless trees‚Äîpeople kneel not out of fear of hell, nor for the desire of heaven, but out of love for each other.</p>

        <p style="margin-top:18px; font-weight:700; text-align:left;">With respect and friendship,<br>A horian, follower of the same light that guides you</p>
