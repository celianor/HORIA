  <h1>Aristotelian Treatise: A Comparative Analysis of Horia with Islam, Christianity, and Buddhism</h1>
  <h3>By a philosopher reflecting on religion and truth</h3>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Religion, in its authentic sense, is a response to humanity’s fundamental questions: Who am I? Why do I suffer? How should I live? Is death an end or a beginning?
      Unlike the believer or priest, the philosopher does not assume the sanctity of religion, but rather its rational possibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, this treatise does not judge religions based on faith, miracles, or tradition, but rather through Aristotle’s four causes, the foundation of rational inquiry:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Final cause – What is its purpose?<br>
      2. Material cause – What is it made of?<br>
      3. Formal cause – What is its structure?<br>
      4. Efficient cause – Who or what initiated it?
    </p>
    <p>
      We examine Horia — a modern spiritual path — alongside three ancient world religions: Islam, Christianity, and Buddhism. We aim neither to defend nor to dismiss any religion, but to understand how each relates to reason, freedom, and human dignity.

    <h2>Chapter One: The Final Cause – What is Happiness?</h2>
    <p>According to Aristotle, the final cause is the most important because it defines the "why" of existence. If a religion cannot present a clear, possible, and human-compatible goal, it is incomplete or misaligned with nature.</p>

    <h3>1.1. Horia: Human Flourishing in This World and Beyond</h3>
    <p>
      In Horia, happiness is not a heavenly promise but an earthly responsibility. The human is defined as social, rational, and compassionate. The goal of religion is to help us, through collective effort, build a better world now. Since death is not an end but a physical transition to another world, doing good here makes sense.
      Faith in Horia is not fear of hell or hope for reward, but the freedom to act kindly. Religion becomes an ethical-social language for organizing a good life.
    </p>

    <h3>1.2. Islam: Submission to the One God and Eternal Paradise</h3>
    <p>
      In Islam, happiness lies in complete submission to God's will. Humans are servants; God is the master. Life's purpose is to reach paradise and avoid hell through obedience to divine law.
      Here, reason serves revelation and is not an independent source of guidance. Religion is a fixed path revealed through the Prophet and the Quran. To be religious is to submit.
    </p>

    <h3>1.3. Christianity: Salvation from Sin and Union with Divine Love</h3>
    <p>
      In Christianity, the human is a sinner who cannot be saved without divine grace. Salvation is not achieved through deeds but through faith in Christ.
      Happiness is the experience of God’s unconditional love, embodied in Jesus. Religion is an invitation to believe, not a legal obligation.
      A good life means union with God and following Christ’s love, not simply earning rewards.
    </p>

    <h3>1.4. Buddhism: Liberation from Suffering and Attaining Nirvana</h3>
    <p>
      In Buddhism, the final goal is liberation from the cycle of suffering and rebirth. Humans are trapped by ignorance and attachment. Only through inner discipline, meditation, and mental release can one attain Nirvana — a state of complete stillness.
      God is not central here, nor is the afterlife in the traditional sense. The focus is psychological and mental freedom. Religion is a practice of peace, not a system of judgment.
    </p>

    <h3>1.5. Comparative Analysis Based on Aristotle</h3>
    <p>
      Aristotle saw happiness in the realization of human virtue in social life. Though he didn’t teach religion, his tools allow us to think:
      <br>• In Horia, religion complements reason and helps build a good life with others.
      <br>• In Islam, religion is a command from outside; reason follows revelation.
      <br>• In Christianity, religion is a loving bond with the saving God; reason plays a minor role.
      <br>• In Buddhism, religion is an inward path of calmness; the outer world is secondary.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The final cause is that for the sake of which something exists.” Thus, the better religion is the one that most enables a person to become more human — affirming reason, compassion, and freedom — which, in Aristotelian terms, is found in Horia.
