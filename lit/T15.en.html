    <h1>On the Wisdom of the People Over the Rule of the Ruler</h1>

    <p>In a distant land, a man arrived from a troubled realm where the kingdom had fallen into decay. The kings no longer listened, and the people no longer dared to speak.</p>

    <p>As he set foot in a city beneath the sun, he saw cheerful faces, a peaceful spirit, vibrant marketplaces, and hearts at ease.</p>

    <p>He asked an old man with a clear gaze and a calm soul:<br>
    — “O elder, wise and time-worn, who holds the power here? Who commands and who rules?”</p>

    <p>The old man replied:<br>
    “We have no sultan and no lord, no single will that dictates, no tyrant that binds. Whoever speaks is heard, and whoever hears silences their pride.<br>
    We consult one another — calmly, without clamor — and the decision born of collective reason becomes the path we follow.”</p>

    <p>He asked: “But if there is no one who reigns, how are you safe from chaos?”</p>

    <p>The old man said:<br>
    “When a decision is born from many minds, it is not made lightly. And when hearts are bound together, the hand of corruption is cut short.<br>
    In the realm of the sun, authority stems not from rank, but from awareness — not from the sword, but from wisdom.”</p>

    <div class="quote">
      <p>As it is well said:<br>
      A kingdom guided by the mind of one<br>
      Shall falter and fail, undone.<br>
      The wise seek counsel from every side,<br>
      For a lone heart soon loses its guide.</p>
