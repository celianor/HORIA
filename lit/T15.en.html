    <section>
        <h2>Horia Faith</h2>
        <p>"Hora" is with humans, not above them; a voice for dialogue, not dictation. In their faith, kindness, beauty, creativity, and the human right to think form the core of belief. Horians seek meaning in freedom, and freedom in faith—building with Hora, a compassionate and equal God, a world where faith is dialogue, not obedience. They worship a God who commands nothing, but listens; and craft a world where meaning is born of empathy, not fear.</p>

        <h2>Christianity</h2>
        <p>Christians are followers of a love that has suffered—seeing salvation in the sacrifice of a God who took human form. Amid the chime of bells and the melody of the Gospel, they view the cross not as a symbol of defeat, but a bridge to triumph over sin. For them, salvation is found through faith and unconditional love—a path to eternity. They are travelers of the Way of the Cross, bearing the incarnate God through pain and love, devoted to a heavenly love revealed in the face of the crucified.</p>

        <h2>Islam</h2>
        <p>Muslims are submitters to the word of God—a singular, mighty deity revealed with clarity and authority in the Quran. Their religion is discipline and precision, seeking alignment of body and spirit with divine will through prayer, fasting, and pilgrimage. The believer is an obedient servant. They are worshippers of the Word, receiving Heaven’s command through the Quran without question or protest. In the arc of prayer and the direction of command, they sculpt their souls with the light of "submission."</p>

        <h2>Zoroastrianism</h2>
        <p>Zoroastrians are guardians of light—viewing fire as a symbol of truth and thought. In a dual world between Ahura Mazda and Ahriman, they carve their path through good deeds and pure speech. Humanity is seen as an ally of God in the triumph of light. They are devotees of fire and thought, cultivating radiance in the eternal battle between falsehood and truth, keeping the fire in their hearts ablaze with righteousness and goodness.</p>

        <h2>Buddhism</h2>
        <p>Buddhists are seekers of the inner world—with eyes closed yet awakened, in pursuit of freedom from suffering. Under the Bodhi tree, they learned that desire is the root of pain, and liberation lies in letting go of wants. They view life as a cycle that can be transcended only through awareness and compassion. They are walkers of silence, taking calm steps within the depths of self to find liberation from suffering. Quiet pilgrims of the inner garden, blooming awareness on the lotus of silence.</p>

        <h2>Hinduism</h2>
        <p>Hindus are swimmers in a sea of symbols and deities—seeing in every form a face of the divine. Karma, reincarnation, yoga, and the Vedas interpret the universe as a sacred dance. For them, multiplicity leads to unity; the goal is reaching Brahman—a formless, nameless truth beyond all names. They are poets of the cosmos, finding oneness in diversity in the divine play of Lila and Leela.</p>

        <h2>Confucianism</h2>
        <p>Confucians are believers in ethics—not through revelation, but through human wisdom. Family order, respect for elders, loyalty to society, and ceremony are the pillars of their ideal world. A worthy human is one whose inner and outer life is adorned with dignity, humility, and knowledge. They are climbers of the mountain of order, building human nobility on the pillars of ethics through reverence for ancestors and tradition.</p>

        <h2>Taoism</h2>
        <p>Taoists are listeners of silence—believers in a hidden way that cannot be spoken. Like water, soft and penetrating, they move forward without struggle. They see the world as a play of opposites, livable only through letting go and harmony. Tao is the lawless law of existence—nameless, without beginning or end. They are deer on the invisible path, flowing like rivers—without wanting, without struggle—in tune with the music of being. Lovers of flow, living by letting go in harmony with the hidden Way.</p>

        <h2>Shinto</h2>
        <p>Shinto followers worship the spirits of nature—trees, mountains, rivers, and ancestors all carry the spirit of Kami. Among cherry blossoms and temple silence, they find the divine not in distance, but in all sacred things. Their religion has no book or prophet, yet is filled with ritual and respect. For them, the world is home to living spirits, and life is about harmony with its beauty and purity.</p>

Their mission is not to renounce the world but to build it for all. Their Gurus are teachers of light and sacrifice.

        <h2>Judaism</h2>
        <p>Jews are keepers of an ancient covenant—finding God amid the laws etched in stone and the wounds of exile. Their faith is entwined with questioning, and among scripture, language, and memory, they carry the burden of peoplehood as a gem forged in fire. In the echoes of the Torah, they seek traces of God in suffering and exile.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Atheism</h2>
        <p>Atheists are children of thought—without belief in God, not out of meaninglessness, but from deep inquiry into reality. Instead of heaven, they place their hope in humanity—ethics born of empathy, not command. In a silent cosmos, they ignite the flame of awareness themselves, finding meaning in life itself. They are loyal to reason, kindling the human spark in the silence of a godless universe.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Agnosticism</h2>
        <p>Agnostics are devoted to constructive doubt—not deniers nor believers, but those who stand at a threshold where God might or might not be. For them, the question is nobler than absolute answers, and if faith exists, it must rise from awareness, not fear. They are those who stand at the gate—opening a window to inquiry and humility between knowing and not knowing.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Humanism</h2>
        <p>Humanists are believers in human dignity—not replacing God, but placing humanity as the starting point of meaning. Ethics, beauty, and reason are rooted in the human heart, not divine command. In every face, they see a mirror of worth, and in science and art, they celebrate the heights of the human spirit. They draw their ethics not from heaven, but from earthly empathy.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Naturalism and Modern Paganism</h2>
        <p>Modern Pagans are those who return to Earth's embrace—honoring the spirits of trees, the cycle of the moon, and prayers in the wind. They are listeners to Earth’s song—feeling the mystery of existence in the seasons, winds, and lunar rhythms. To them, nature is not inert, but filled with sacred forces. Their religion is to feel, not to know—and in the whisper of leaves, they sense the mystery without need for a book.</p>
