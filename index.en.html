  <p>
    Horaian faith is a philosophy based on a profound understanding of the universe and humanity, and the belief in a unique and perfect God called Hora. Hora is the God of truth, light, and justice; the source of all goodness and perfection, who fills existence with infinite light and gives meaning to everything. This God transcends all mental images, is beyond time and space, and invites humans to follow the path of wisdom and love.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the Horaian vision, the human being is complex and multifaceted, and their creation must be understood within the framework of three successive worlds:
    <br>1. The Previous World: a spiritual and elevated realm where the soul was created and emerged.
    <br>2. The Present World: the material world and present time, the main stage of trial, experience, and growth.
    <br>3. The Subsequent World: the life after death, a phase of evolution and the true continuation of life.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Horaian faith emphasizes that humans carry collective wisdom and are responsible for preserving their own dignity and that of all beings. It calls for self-knowledge, connection with the Previous World, and striving for betterment in the Present World in preparation for the Subsequent World.
  </p>
  <p>
    Horaianism is not just a religion, but a way of life—a path that leads humans toward self-knowledge, peaceful coexistence, and the spreading of justice and goodness; a path illuminated by the light of Hora, guiding toward a more humane future.
