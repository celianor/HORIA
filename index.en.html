The Horaian Faith is a philosophy based on a profound understanding of the universe and humanity, and a belief in the one perfect God called Hora. Hora is the God of truth, light, and justice; the source of all goodness and perfection, who fills existence with endless light and gives meaning to everything. This God transcends all mental images, is beyond time and space, and invites humans to follow the path of wisdom and love.

In the Horaian worldview, humans are complex and multifaceted beings whose creation must be understood within the framework of three successive worlds:
	1.	The Prior World: a spiritual and exalted realm where the soul was created and emerged.
	2.	The Present World: the material world and present time, the main arena for testing, experience, and growth.
	3.	The Subsequent World: life after death, a stage of evolution and the true continuation of life.

The Horaian Faith emphasizes that humans carry collective wisdom and are responsible for preserving their own dignity and that of all beings. It calls upon humans to know themselves, connect with the Prior World, and strive to improve in the Present World to prepare for the Subsequent World.

Horaianism is not just a religion but a way of life; a path that leads humans toward self-knowledge, peaceful coexistence, and the spread of justice and goodness; a path illuminated by the light of Hora guiding toward a more humane future.
