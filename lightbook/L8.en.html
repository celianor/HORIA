    <h1>Tablet VIII - On Kindness to Strangers and the Downtrodden</h1>
    
    <p>
        O human,<br>
        Do not cast the stranger away,<br>
        For he too is a child of the same light that created you.<br>
        And though his garments may differ,<br>
        And his tongue be unfamiliar,<br>
        His heart may speak the language of compassion better than you.<br><br>

        Do not let borders become walls,<br>
        For I made the earth without borders,<br>
        And people without cages.<br>
        It was you who drew the lines,<br>
        And set fear to guard them.<br><br>

        O human,<br>
        Every stranger who knocks upon your door<br>
        Is a hand tested by Me.<br>
        Watch what you do with him:<br>
        If you reject him,<br>
        Beware lest you too be turned away from grace.<br><br>

        And the downtrodden,<br>
        Whoever they may be,<br>
        Are reminders that power<br>
        Is a trust, not a privilege.<br>
        And strength<br>
        A tool to lift others up,<br>
        Not a ladder to superiority.<br><br>

        Do not break the heart of the lowly,<br>
        For their sigh is the true voice of justice,<br>
        And their tears may sometimes rise to the heavens<br>
        And fall as the rain of judgment.<br><br>

        O human,<br>
        If you have bread,<br>
        Give a portion of it.<br>
        And if you have a home,<br>
        Make a corner of it a refuge<br>
        For the one who has none.<br><br>

        And if your heart beats for justice,<br>
        Speak to the stranger as you would to a friend,<br>
        Not as one you fear and would drive away.<br><br>

        For in My sight,<br>
        Neither blood, nor race, nor tongue<br>
        Brings superiority,<br>
        But only a kind heart,<br>
        And a hand that is open,<br>
        Not clenched.<br><br>

        So be such, O human,<br>
        That if one day you are without shelter,<br>
        And you knock on the doors of others,<br>
        You hear a voice of kindness,<br>
        Not see a closed door and a hard gaze.
    </p>
