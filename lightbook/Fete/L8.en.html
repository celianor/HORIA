  <h1>Collective Wisdom, Light of Unity</h1>

  <p>In the warmth of life’s enchanting table,<br />
  Where melodies of love dance in the breeze,<br />
  And smiles bloom like flowers in hearts,<br />
  Where eyes gaze at one another with longing,<br />
  Words are not tools for superiority, but bridges of closeness.<br />
  This time, the talk was about collective wisdom,<br />
  And the virtue of decisions born from all opinions,<br />
  Not from the power of one alone.</p>

  <div class="divider">— — —</div>

  <p>They gathered,<br />
  Not on a high podium,<br />
  Nor in a palace of proud marble,<br />
  But on the simple ground of understanding,<br />
  Among equal hearts,<br />
  Asking humbly:<br />
  “How do we choose a path,<br />
  Not mine,<br />
  Nor yours,<br />
  But ours,<br />
  The path of union?”</p>

  <div class="divider">— — —</div>

  <p>God said, with a gaze deeper than a thousand oceans,<br />
  Like light in the silent night:<br />
  “O children of light,<br />
  I did not create you to be alone,<br />
  But to be together,<br />
  Not in the unity of solitude,<br />
  But in the bond of union.<br />
  Thought is not for isolation,<br />
  But for consultation.<br />
  Wisdom in one heart<br />
  Is like wax in the wind.<br />
  But when it flows in many hearts,<br />
  It is dawn over endless plains.”</p>

  <p>“Learn to listen,<br />
  Not to reply,<br />
  But to understand.<br />
  Learn to open tongues,<br />
  Not to dominate,<br />
  But to build.<br />
  And know:<br />
  Every idea left alone,<br />
  Withers in itself,<br />
  But if it sees itself in another’s mirror,<br />
  It blossoms,<br />
  Grows,<br />
  And sparkles.”</p>

  <div class="divider">— — —</div>

  <p>Man said:<br />
  “O Lord, I have tried,<br />
  And seen and tested for years,<br />
  But sometimes the other is new.<br />
  His heart beats,<br />
  His eyes full of dreams,<br />
  And sometimes, we do not know<br />
  How to choose a path without conflict,<br />
  That does not hurt the heart,<br />
  Nor disdain the mind.”</p>

  <div class="divider">— — —</div>

  <p>The angel said in a voice soft as morning dew,<br />
  And a smile silver-colored like peace:<br />
  “Collective wisdom is a rare jewel,<br />
  That grows only in humble hearts.<br />
  He who listens silently<br />
  Is worthy to be heard,<br />
  Not the one who shouts.<br />
  And decisions born from the heart of the group,<br />
  Are like springs from the mountain’s heart,<br />
  Calm,<br />
  Yet steady,<br />
  Pure,<br />
  And sincere.”</p>

  <div class="divider">— — —</div>

  <p>In that moment, a child said,<br />
  While arranging the beads of his colorful toy,<br />
  With radiant simplicity:<br />
  “My friends and I build a house.<br />
  I want the roof blue,<br />
  He wants it green,<br />
  The third doesn’t want a roof at all!<br />
  At first, we are sad,<br />
  But then we laugh together,<br />
  And build a striped roof,<br />
  A rainbow for our hearts.<br />
  And always, that house<br />
  Is more beautiful than anyone’s choice alone.”</p>

  <div class="divider">— — —</div>

  <p>God smiled,<br />
  Not from knowledge,<br />
  But from joy in such simplicity,<br />
  And said:<br />
  “O my child,<br />
  You have known the secret of unity.<br />
  Beauty is not in the dominance of one opinion,<br />
  But in the blending of colors,<br />
  And in union.<br />
  What emerges from the hearts of the group,<br />
  Is greater than the imagination of any individual,<br />
  And is the sacred path born from ‘we.’”</p>

  <div class="divider">— — —</div>

  <p>Man said, with clearer eyes,<br />
  And a calmer heart:<br />
  “So, O Lord,<br />
  For knowledge,<br />
  We must learn to listen.<br />
  For decision,<br />
  We must equalize hearts,<br />
  And for building,<br />
  We must overcome the pride of a single mind,<br />
  And turn to the embrace of collective wisdom.”</p>

  <div class="divider">— — —</div>

  <p>The angel said:<br />
  “Yes,<br />
  Where many good hearts flow,<br />
  And many awake minds,<br />
  And many sincere tongues,<br />
  Like rivers pouring into one sea,<br />
  Wisdom becomes light,<br />
  And decisions<br />
  Gain the color of God,<br />
  Not in one mind,<br />
  But in the harmony of the group.”</p>

  <div class="divider">— — —</div>

  <p>And the table of life lit anew.<br />
  Not from one light,<br />
  But from a thousand candles,<br />
  Lit together.<br />
  And the sky carried a silent love:<br />
  “A good fate,<br />
  Springs from hearts beating together,<br />
  Not from one hand<br />
  Trembling in the wind.”</p>
