  <h1>Song of Sorrow and Return</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <p class="verse">
    That night, when the songs of joy fell silent,<br>
    and the melody of life sank into a veil of hush,<br>
    the candles trembled, like hearts full of wonder,<br>
    and shadows wrote their stories upon the walls of the soul.
    </p>

    <p class="verse">
    Sorrow came.<br>
    Not with loud cries,<br>
    but with quiet steps,<br>
    like a breeze passing through the garden of memory.<br>
    And in its eyes, countless nights were hidden,<br>
    centuries of silent tears.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p class="speaker">God said:</p>
    <p class="verse">
    O friends of light,<br>
    Sorrow is the child of separation,<br>
    born of a heart’s deep longing…<br>
    Not an enemy,<br>
    but a messenger from distant homes.<br><br>

    It is a mirror that reflects the soul,<br>
    a lantern<br>
    that, even in the darkest night,<br>
    carries the flicker of hope.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p class="speaker">The Human said:</p>
    <p class="verse">
    O light of my soul,<br>
    I have dwelled for years in the shadow of sorrow:<br>
    the sorrow of farewells,<br>
    the sorrow of powerlessness,<br>
    the solitude that whispers your name…<br>
    And at times, I thought I lost you,<br>
    thought you had forsaken me…<br>
    Are these sufferings in vain?<br>
    Does not this pain speak of your absence?
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p class="speaker">The Angel said:</p>
    <p class="verse">
    No, O soul-weary traveler,<br>
    sorrow is not the sign of God's absence,<br>
    but the trace of His presence.<br>
    A tear is the soul’s whisper,<br>
    and pain is the soil<br>
    where the seed of light begins to grow.<br>
    A broken heart is a house<br>
    where God walks barefoot.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p class="speaker">The Child said:</p>
    <p class="verse">
    Yesterday I cried…<br>
    my toy broke.<br>
    My world suddenly turned dark.<br>
    But my mother said:<br>
    “Sometimes things break<br>
    to make space for something new.”<br><br>

    And today,<br>
    with the very same pieces,<br>
    I built a house…<br>
    where light sings again.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p class="speaker">God smiled and said:</p>
    <p class="verse">
    My child,<br>
    you hold wisdom,<br>
    though you know not its name.<br><br>

    Sorrow, when embraced in love,<br>
    becomes insight.<br>
    And when mingled with hope,<br>
    it gives birth to new life.<br><br>

    I am hidden<br>
    within your tears,<br>
    and each tear<br>
    is a stream flowing toward Me.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p class="speaker">The Human said:</p>
    <p class="verse">
    Then let me weep,<br>
    not out of weakness,<br>
    but from the longing to understand more deeply.<br><br>

    Let me not deny my sorrow,<br>
    but listen to it,<br>
    and let it carry me, drop by drop,<br>
    to the ocean of You.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p class="speaker">The Angel said:</p>
    <p class="verse">
    And sorrow, once accepted,<br>
    becomes rain upon the soil of the heart.<br>
    And if mingled with love,<br>
    becomes a spring in the desert.<br><br>

    It is no enemy,<br>
    but a guide;<br>
    not a wound,<br>
    but a passage to light.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p class="verse">
    And that night,<br>
    that night when the stars<br>
    listened to silence,<br>
    sorrow was no longer a guest…<br>
    but a friend.<br><br>

    Not to remain,<br>
    but to take the hand and help pass through.<br><br>

    And the heart, after its passage,<br>
    grew more awake,<br>
    more tender,<br>
    and more familiar…<br>
    with <a href="https://celianor.github.io/Horia/index.en.html">God</a>.
