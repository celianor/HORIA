  <h1>Feast of Life: Hymn of Tenderness and Mirror of Love</h1>

  <p>In the heart of the feast of life, candles danced softly,<br />
  The gentle breeze hummed a tender melody,<br />
  And the pure assembly — God, human, angel, and child —<br />
  Gathered in a circle of light and hope,<br />
  To sing an eternal hymn in the language of kindness.</p>

  <p>God, with eyes that held the heavens, said:<br />
  O children of light and silence,<br />
  Kindness is a breath from my soul breathed into yours,<br />
  And love is a mirror in which you see yourselves.<br />
  I created humanity out of love,<br />
  That they might be like trees in the harsh winds of life,<br />
  Flexible and yielding,<br />
  Generous and intertwined,<br />
  Bearing witness to the boundless presence of love.</p>

  <p>Human, with tearful eyes and a trembling voice, said:<br />
  But O merciful God,<br />
  Loving is not easy,<br />
  When hearts are wounded and broken,<br />
  When cruelty builds cold walls between people,<br />
  How can one soften the heart?<br />
  How can we let go of ourselves and love?</p>

  <p>The angel, with a melody of light, responded:<br />
  Loving is the art of forgiveness,<br />
  Letting go of self, pride, and old wounds,<br />
  Kindness blooms in pain,<br />
  When you say:<br />
  “I understand you, even though you have hurt me.”<br />
  And this is a song only awakened souls hear.</p>

  <p>The child, with a simple heart and clear gaze, said:<br />
  When I love, I want to laugh with them,<br />
  Forgive them, even if they break my toys,<br />
  Loving means not getting angry,<br />
  And giving your heart anew each day,<br />
  Like a fresh, endless morning.</p>

  <p>God smiled and said:<br />
  Yes, this is the secret,<br />
  In the simplicity of the child, in the purity of angels’ intent,<br />
  In the honesty of the human who battles pain,<br />
  Yet still can love,<br />
  Loving is the salvation of one’s own soul,<br />
  From the sorrow of separation and the darkness of loneliness,<br />
  And kindness is the common language of loving hearts.</p>

  <p>Human sighed and said:<br />
  If only the world spoke the language of kindness,<br />
  If only there were no walls between borders,<br />
  If only we could love all, regardless of color, race, or name,<br />
  Like you, O God,<br />
  Who loves all unconditionally.</p>

  <p>The angel spread its wings like a banner of peace and said:<br />
  Yes, it is a dream,<br />
  But dreams are the seeds of reality,<br />
  Every act of kindness is a small flame,<br />
  That, joined with other hearts,<br />
  Will warm the world.</p>

  <p>The child took the human’s hand and said:<br />
  Let’s play the game of kindness,<br />
  You smile, I will kiss you,<br />
  Let us tell everyone:<br />
  “The world will be more beautiful,<br />
  If we remain kind.”</p>

  <p>And night passed in light,<br />
  In the feast of life, where every word was a seed of love,<br />
  And every heart a stream flowing to the sea of love,<br />
  For in kindness, God draws near,<br />
  And in love, humanity becomes God.</p>
