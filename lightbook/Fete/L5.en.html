  <h1>For Competition, Glory, and Heroism</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <p>In the <a href="https://celianor.github.io/Horia/lightbook/Fete/index.en.html">Feast of Life</a>,<br />
    Where hearts intertwine with the melody of love,<br />
    And the sky lends its ear to the whisper of existence,<br />
    The moment has come for delicate and profound words:<br />
    Competition… and the desire to excel.</p>

    <p>A gentle silence embraced the stage;<br />
    Not out of fear,<br />
    But under the weight of meaning.</p>

    <p>Then, <span class="speaker">Hora</span>,<br />
    With a voice echoing in the heart of mountains<br />
    And soothing the soul like a calm sea, said:</p>

    <p class="verse">
    O creatures of light,<br />
    Competition is a sacred fire,<br />
    When blended with kindness and igniting the inner flame.<br />
    It is a spring breeze that brings the soul to bloom,<br />
    And a pure thunderclap that wakes the will from sleep.<br /><br />

    But if this fire is kindled with the intent to reduce others to ashes,<br />
    It is poison in a golden cup,<br />
    A deceptive glory.<br /><br />

    The effort to improve is a light in the darkness,<br />
    And heroism, the soul’s flight toward the peaks.<br />
    But victory gained by crushing others<br />
    Is a shadow upon the face of light.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p class="speaker">Man said:</p>
    <p class="verse">
    O enlightener of the soul,<br />
    I strive to rise higher,<br />
    I want to be a hero, to shine, to surge,<br />
    Yet I feel the shadow of another upon my shoulder,<br />
    And sometimes I fear that my efforts bring sorrow to another’s heart.<br />
    Is this desire for excellence a sin?
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p class="speaker">Angel said:</p>
    <p class="verse">
    No, O seeking human,<br />
    He who wishes to shine must surge,<br />
    Heroism, if walked in the right way,<br />
    Is not just a good deed, but the noblest of deeds.<br /><br />

    The peak is the home of those who dedicate their soul to flight.<br />
    But the hero will shine<br />
    When, at the peak, instead of pride, he carries the torch of hope for others.<br /><br />

    Excellence is blossoming, not the elimination of others;<br />
    And competition is a mirror to see oneself, not a dagger to break others.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p class="speaker">Child said:</p>
    <p class="verse">
    I run with my friend,<br />
    I want to arrive before him.<br />
    But if he arrives first, I still smile.<br />
    Because we play together,<br />
    And if he is the hero today,<br />
    Perhaps tomorrow it will be my turn.<br />
    Heroism is a game of light;<br />
    And if we both smile,<br />
    We both have won.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p class="speaker">Hora smiled and said:</p>
    <p class="verse">
    Child, you carry a melody of eternal wisdom within.<br />
    On every field, be it <a href="bazm-honar.html">sports</a>, <a href="bazm-danesh.html">science</a>, or <a href="bazm-avaz.html">art</a>,<br />
    Competition, when born from kindness, is a celebration of human grandeur.<br /><br />

    The hero is not the one who rises higher alone,<br />
    But the one who also raises the hand of their rival,<br />
    And says: “Without you, this flight was incomplete.”<br /><br />

    The one who draws inspiration from another’s radiance<br />
    Is already victorious,<br />
    Because they have come with open eyes.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p class="speaker">Man whispered:</p>
    <p class="verse">
    I wish to be a hero,<br />
    Without inviting pride into my heart;<br />
    To stand at the peak,<br />
    Without throwing anyone into the abyss.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p class="speaker">Angel said:</p>
    <p class="verse">
    Then rise!<br />
    Run with all your soul,<br />
    Strive with all your might!<br />
    Shine, without fear!<br />
    Seek the peak,<br />
    But with a light others can also follow.<br /><br />

    And competition becomes sacred,<br />
    When you shine so others believe in the light,<br />
    When you shout: “The way is open! Come!”<br />
    Not to silence the cries of others.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p class="verse">
    And the feast of life was once again filled with song,<br />
    With true passion, with the fervor of heroism.<br />
    Where competition was not a battle of shadows,<br />
    But a dance of light on the heights.<br />
    And excellence found a new meaning:<br />
    Rising,<br />
    Without bending others;<br />
    Shining,<br />
    So that a bright path remains.
