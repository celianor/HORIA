  <h1>Song of Harmony and Voice</h1>

  <p>That night — serene, moon-kissed —<br>
  when the stars blinked gently like whispering eyes,<br>
  and the breeze, like a loving hand, caressed the face of the world,<br>
  the companions gathered,<br>
  to speak of song,<br>
  of melody,<br>
  of the mystery of harmony.</p>

  <p><strong>God</strong>, smiling a smile that lit the heart of night, said:<br>
  O dear friends,<br>
  I created the world with sound, not silence.<br>
  I said, “Be!” — and a song arose.<br>
  The river began to murmur,<br>
  the wind danced the leaves into music,<br>
  and the human heart, from the very beginning,<br>
  beat with longing for a sweet melody.</p>

  <p><strong>The Human</strong>, eyes weary from the night, voice wrapped in emotion, said:<br>
  O God,<br>
  I love to sing,<br>
  for every time I do,<br>
  my heart feels light,<br>
  and sorrow takes the shape of flight.<br>
  Yet sometimes I wonder:<br>
  why are some hearts silent?<br>
  why are some voices broken inside the throat?</p>

  <p><strong>The Angel</strong>, with eyes brighter than dawn and a voice like a mountain spring, replied:<br>
  Song is the mirror of the soul;<br>
  and a dust-covered mirror cannot reflect light.<br>
  But harmony heals the silent hearts.<br>
  When one sings, another heart begins to tremble,<br>
  and in that trembling, the voice awakens.<br>
  The soul’s songs, like rivers,<br>
  flow into one another and become ocean.</p>

  <p><strong>The Child</strong>, laughing a laugh that made the sun blush, said:<br>
  I always sing!<br>
  When I run, I sing,<br>
  when I fall, I still sing,<br>
  even when no one loves me,<br>
  I sing...<br>
  because I know God hears my voice,<br>
  and maybe someone’s heart will be warmed by my song.</p>

  <p><strong>God</strong>, with a tone soft as dawn, said:<br>
  Bravo, dear bright-hearted child,<br>
  you have found the secret.<br>
  Song is the magic of love;<br>
  harmony is the rebirth of connection.<br>
  In a world so full of loneliness,<br>
  the heart’s voice declares: “I exist... and so do you...”<br>
  and together, we complete the melody of being.</p>

  <p><strong>The Human</strong> sighed and said:<br>
  Sometimes I feel my song is out of tune —<br>
  with the world, with people,<br>
  even with my own soul...<br>
  but perhaps, if I go quiet and truly listen,<br>
  I might hear the voices of others<br>
  and among those melodies,<br>
  find the one I lost inside.</p>

  <p><strong>The Angel</strong>, with a gentle smile, said:<br>
  The beauty of song is not in sameness,<br>
  but in difference — in the diversity of voices.<br>
  Harmony means:<br>
  each one sings their own tune,<br>
  but in union with others, becomes one.<br>
  And that is the secret of creation’s music.</p>

  <p><strong>The Child</strong>, lifting hands toward the sky, cried out:<br>
  Let us sing!<br>
  With heart, with smile, with childlike joy —<br>
  for the birds, for the trees, for each other,<br>
  and even for those who have forgotten their voice!</p>

  <p>And so it happened, in the depth of night,<br>
  each one, with a soul-born melody,<br>
  sang a shared song.<br>
  God was heard in that harmony —<br>
  not in words,<br>
  but in the trembling of hearts,<br>
  in a silence that turned to song,<br>
  in a music that went on forever…</p>
