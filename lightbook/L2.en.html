    <h2>Tablet Two: On Justice and Judgment<br>In Praise of Justice, Patience, and Deep Insight</h2>

    <p>O Human, <br>
    A day will come when you shall stand in judgment; <br>
    not only on the judge’s seat, <br>
    but in every gaze you cast, <br>
    every silence you keep, <br>
    and every choice you make.</p>

    <p>So listen: <br>
    Justice is not merely to punish the wrongdoer, <br>
    if you do not understand what lies behind the fault, <br>
    what pain, what need, <br>
    what darkness has born it. <br>
    Justice is to know the wound, <br>
    and seek healing instead of revenge. <br>
    For judgment without understanding the roots <br>
    is not justice, but anger in the guise of decree.</p>

    <p>Do not meet fault with the sword, <br>
    but look into the depths of the soul, <br>
    and ask: <br>
    "How did this dark seed come to grow in this soil?"</p>

    <p>Justice without knowledge <br>
    is anger, not fairness; <br>
    and judgment without mercy <br>
    is a stone, not the balance of justice.</p>

    <p>Hear every human being <br>
    before you judge them; <br>
    and test every testimony <br>
    before you rely on it. <br>
    For truth does not reveal itself easily, <br>
    and justice is a narrow path <br>
    between two deceits.</p>

    <p>A judge who closes one eye <br>
    silences other voices; <br>
    and one who does not hear the weak <br>
    is far from me, Hora, <br>
    even if they speak my name.</p>

    <p>O Human, <br>
    I have appointed judgment for peace, <br>
    not for domination; <br>
    for restoration, not for rejection. <br>
    That the wrongdoer may find a way back to the light, <br>
    not be lost in the depths of despair.</p>

    <p>When you can enlighten a heart with justice, <br>
    and kindle light in a fallen soul, <br>
    then you shall be a true judge. <br>
    And if you cannot, <br>
    be silent; <br>
    for the silence of the wise judge <br>
    is better than the shout of the blind one.</p>
