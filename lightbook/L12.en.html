  <h1>Tablet XII – In Praise of Beauty, Art, and Creation</h1>

  <p>O child of dreams and dust,<br>
  In the beginning, I did not shape you from law,<br>
  Nor from rule or fear,<br>
  But I gave you life through passion,<br>
  Through the yearning to create,<br>
  And the nameless pulse of beauty.<br>
  I sang you into being with a hidden flame.</p>

  <p>And when I wished you to remain,<br>
  I placed no sword in your hand,<br>
  But gave you a pen to write from the soul,<br>
  A mirror,<br>
  And a lute to turn the sigh of being into melody.</p>

  <p>I placed art within you,<br>
  Not as adornment, but as unveiling,<br>
  So that what stirs in the deepest layer of your being<br>
  Might rise and spread its wings<br>
  Through dance, through line, through song.</p>

  <p>I did not craft beauty to deceive,<br>
  For deceit is the mirror of illusion;<br>
  Beauty was born to awaken,<br>
  Wherever a tear falls without a name,<br>
  Wherever a smile shines without words,<br>
  There you shall find my trace.</p>

  <p>O human,<br>
  When you behold the wonder of creation,<br>
  When your heart trembles at the sight of a bird,<br>
  When you find the Divine in the stroke of a calligraphy,<br>
  And hear a breath in the silence of a sculpture<br>
  That you have never heard before—<br>
  Know that I have kissed you,<br>
  Directly, without a name, without a veil.</p>

  <p>The artist is one<br>
  Who with dust-covered hands and burning eyes<br>
  Creates a world out of nothing,<br>
  A world where many souls may find shelter.</p>

  <p>The creator is not the one who obeys,<br>
  But the one who, instead of imitation,<br>
  Answers existence with their own melody;<br>
  And if that answer rises from depth,<br>
  Even if silent,<br>
  It shall be heard.</p>

  <p>A temple without music,<br>
  A heart unmoved by image,<br>
  A faith that does not kiss the artist’s hand—<br>
  Bears no trace of Me.</p>

  <p>So, O human,<br>
  Create.<br>
  Not for applause,<br>
  But for the rising of your own being,<br>
  For the birth of your soul from within.<br>
  For you are my mirror,<br>
  And when you create,<br>
  I appear in you.</p>
