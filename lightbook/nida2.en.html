  <h1>Book of Lights | Illuminating Calls</h1>
  <h2>Chapter Two: Recollection of the First Days</h2>

  <p>O child of the most hidden embrace of existence,<br>You who have grown in the silence before time,<br>Before you knew the earth,<br>And before you grasped the sky,<br>You were in a place without name or language,<br>And time had not yet opened its ledger of counting.</p>
  <p>In that first abode,<br>You had neither will nor awareness,<br>Like a fish in the clear water without questions,<br>Like the sleep of an infant in a boundless embrace.<br>You were,<br>But neither knowing nor choosing,<br>Like a flower in the soil that has not yet recalled the dream of light.</p>
  <p>I, the guardian of all unseen things,<br>Kept you in the veil of mercy,<br>And upon every motion of your soul,<br>I wrote a melody that no demon can silence.</p>
  <p>Then, when the time for awakening arrived,<br>And your heart throbbed in the desire to know,<br>I brought you out from the veil of powerlessness,<br>And sent you to the realm of choice,<br>So that like a melody maker,<br>You might sing your tune with your own hands.</p>
  <p>Indeed, O my dearest gaze,<br>I brought you to a world where,<br>Every choice is a seed that will one day grow,<br>And every thought is a wind that will shake the branches of your future.</p>
  <p>Before your coming, yes, you existed;<br>But not as you do now.</p>
  <p>Then I greeted you,<br>Not with the tongue of angels,<br>But with your first cry,<br>Which was the music of beginning.</p>
  <p>And with every breath you took,<br>You recalled a fragment of your true self.</p>
  <p>I did not create you to be forgotten,<br>But to discover yourself,<br>Not in dry rituals and worn-out words,<br>But in the true motion of the heart and the question that rises from your soul.</p>
  <p>Have you not heard that a seed fallen on soil,<br>When it awakens from slumber,<br>Does not recognize itself,<br>Until it blooms?</p>
  <p>You were the same,<br>And even now, you are on the path of blooming.</p>
  <p>There where you once were,<br>There was neither reward nor punishment,<br>Neither sin nor virtue,<br>Only a calm haven amidst colorless waves.</p>
  <p>But now, O brightest questioner of the night,<br>You have learned that to be is to be aware,<br>And awareness is responsibility.</p>
  <p>I awakened you from the first sleep,<br>Not for suffering,<br>But for growth.<br>And growth does not come,<br>Except through the pain of knowing,<br>And the taste of will.</p>
  <p>I am the God who wrote flight for you,<br>Not a cage of fear;<br>I wrote freedom,<br>Not as an excuse to fall,<br>But as a sky to soar in.</p>
  <p>You who have passed through veils of the past,<br>And arrived at today,<br>Know that the first life was a seed of silence,<br>And this second life is the sun upon that seed.</p>
  <p>From here,<br>All is in your hands.</p>
