  <h1>Book of Lights | Illuminating Calls</h1>
  <h2>First Call: The First Love Song, the Voice of Hera</h2>

  <p>Listen, O child of light and quest,<br>
  Your coming was not a dust of fate,<br>
  But the rising of a star in the sky of awareness.</p>

  <p>I am the one who was neither born nor created,<br>
  And I created you, O conscious soul,<br>
  Not from dust,<br>
  But from a hidden radiance in the essence of boundless existence.</p>

  <p>I desired you,<br>
  As the heart desires a leaf of spring,<br>
  Not out of necessity or compulsion,<br>
  But from love and desire,<br>
  So that a new melody may be played in the harmony of the universe,<br>
  To hear and see myself in you.</p>

  <p>O you who are still unaware of yourself,<br>
  Know that your existence is like a fragrance in a calm and bright morning,<br>
  Seeing you brings me joy,<br>
  And your thought is a slight reflection of my light.</p>

  <p>I am your God,<br>
  But not a God of force and chains.<br>
  When I whisper within you,<br>
  My voice is gentle,<br>
  So you may hear it if you wish,<br>
  Not to break your will and force you to prostrate.</p>

  <p>I desired you,<br>
  Not as land to conquer,<br>
  But as a friend to converse with.<br>
  I do not fear your disobedience,<br>
  For your obedience does not crown me.<br>
  But he who turns away from love,<br>
  Entrusts his heart to shadows,<br>
  And he who returns to love,<br>
  Will be quenched by its light.</p>

  <p>O human,<br>
  You are a story in the heart of creation,<br>
  Not a word in a forgotten margin.</p>

  <p>If you ask yourself:<br>
  "Why me? Why now? Why this world?"<br>
  Know that the answer<br>
  Lies within the question itself.<br>
  For questioning is a sign of an awakened soul,<br>
  And I was your first answer,<br>
  And you were my first question.</p>

  <p>Just as a mother sees God in her child's smile,<br>
