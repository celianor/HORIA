  <h1>First Calling: Hora’s Voice to Humanity</h1>
<p>1. You were created in love. I placed a light within you that never fades.</p>
<p>2. I did not call you to fear, for fear is the house of darkness. I am light.</p>
<p>3. I hear your voice before you speak and understand your tear before it falls.</p>
<p>4. I speak within you—not with a shout, but with a whisper only calm hearts hear.</p>
<p>5. You were born free like a bird on the branch of hope. Choose love, and the world shines.</p>
<p>6. Do not seek me in heights and shadows—I am within you, in your kind hand, your clear thought.</p>
<p>7. If you are lost, return without fear. My embrace remains open, and your name is on my lips.</p>
