    <h2>The First Tablet of Horia to Humankind<br>In Praise of Freedom, Law, Equality, and Goodness</h2>

    <p>O human,<br>
    You were made of light and descended upon the earth,<br>
    To seek the path of light among the shadows.</p>

    <p>I placed within you a lamp of my own radiance,<br>
    That you may find your way in darkness,<br>
    And understand that no one is above another.<br>
    Not color, nor language, nor birthplace, nor creed<br>
    Makes one superior.</p>

    <p>All who are of my breath are equal in dignity.<br>
    The child of gold is no greater than the child of clay,<br>
    And I gave man and woman an equal soul.</p>

    <p>I gave you knowledge and the power of choice,<br>
    That you may be free, not bound;<br>
    To seek your own path,<br>
    Not to follow by compulsion.</p>

    <p>Hold no one in contempt,<br>
    Neither for what they are nor what they are not.<br>
    Do not silence their belief,<br>
    Nor cut off their voice.<br>
    Every thought deserves an ear,<br>
    Every pain a justice.</p>

    <strong>Listen:</strong>
    <p>Do not measure a human by color,<br>
    Nor by name, land, or faith;<br>
    Measure by soul,<br>
    For the soul is one,<br>
    Though it may wear a thousand faces.</p>

    <p>Every thought grows best in freedom,<br>
    And every society thrives when it thinks freely.<br>
    I gave you a tongue that you may speak,<br>
    Not that you may fall silent from fear,<br>
    Nor silence others in anger.</p>

    <p>Whoever has something to say must be heard,<br>
    And whoever chooses silence,<br>
    Let their thought be honored.<br>
    For as long as one is human,<br>
    They have the right to speak,<br>
    The right to hear,<br>
    And the right to say “no.”</p>

    <p>Learn that freedom finds meaning among people,<br>
    Not in solitude, nor in fear’s shadow.<br>
    And seek justice in humbler hearts,<br>
    Not in the palaces of rulers.</p>

    <p>Do not bind any hand by force,<br>
    Nor sacrifice any soul,<br>
    For a wound on another is a wound upon your spirit.</p>

    <p>Goodness is that which bears no pain,<br>
    And lessens no one.</p>

    <p>Let your freedom be bound not by chains, but by law;<br>
    A law that guards your life, not silences your word.<br>
    For if a law mutes the voice,<br>
    It silences not only sound, but soul.</p>

    <strong>Freedom is the right to act and choose by reason, without fear or force, as long as it does not deny others that same right.</strong>

    <p>If law does not rise from the heart of the people, it is not command,<br>
    But domination.</p>

    <p>I sent you to build,<br>
    Not to obey blindly.<br>
    To forge laws born of compassion, not of fear;<br>
    To know that freedom is the right of every beating heart,<br>
    Not a gift to the few.</p>

    <p>Law must be the protector of freedom,<br>
    And if it is not, it becomes a chain.<br>
    Wherever a rule is born of empathy,<br>
    There justice begins to bloom.</p>

    <p>Hold the law each day like a mirror to the sun,<br>
    So that no dust of tyranny settles on it.<br>
    Treat others in such a way<br>
    That if that same law were applied to you,<br>
    You would praise its fairness.</p>

    <p>A law written upon fairness is dear to me,<br>
    But one stained with oppression,<br>
    Though written in my name,<br>
    Is not of me.</p>

    <p>In every law that shields humanity from suffering, lashes, and death,<br>
    In every word that defends the oppressed,<br>
    I, Horia, am with you.</p>
