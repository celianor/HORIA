  <h1>Tablet Six – On Protecting the Earth and Animals</h1>

  <hr>

  <div class="verse">
    O human,<br>
    I did not spread the Earth for your dominance,<br>
    nor to wear a crown and rule over it.<br>
    I created you to be its companion—<br>
    like a gardener with a luminous heart,<br>
    who finds pride not in soil, but in union with it.
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    Look at the shrub sprouting through stone,<br>
    or the bird praying with the breeze.<br>
    The Earth speaks to you—<br>
    not with the tongue of people,<br>
    but with the trembling of leaves,<br>
    the bubbling of springs,<br>
    the rising of mist,<br>
    and the silence of dewdrops on wheat fields.
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    Take from her, yes,<br>
    for she is generous,<br>
    but take in measure of your worth,<br>
    not the measure of your greed.<br>
    For every grain unjustly taken<br>
    will return as pain—<br>
    in your soul,<br>
    in your child,<br>
    in the air you breathe.
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    O human,<br>
    I created animals too—<br>
    not as ornaments in your markets,<br>
    but as silent melodies of creation’s song.<br>
    Do not call them your subjects;<br>
    call them your kin.<br>
    Read from their eyes;<br>
    for the cry of a forsaken fawn,<br>
    or the distant song of a great whale,<br>
    are words from the book of silent existence.
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    Do not strike the root of a tree<br>
    whose shade you have not yet tasted.<br>
    Do not slay a tree for the beauty of your home—<br>
    for a home without air is but a polished tomb.
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    Do not let rivers be silenced,<br>
    or skies be robbed of their stars,<br>
    so the ceilings of cities remain no lower<br>
    than the ceilings of your dreams.
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    The Earth<br>
    is not a mute servant of obedience,<br>
    but your noble, patient mother.<br>
    And a mother is not to be drained until dry,<br>
    nor burned for a fleeting light.
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    O human,<br>
    if you let wisdom guide your hands,<br>
    and sow compassion into your gaze,<br>
    the Earth will bloom again,<br>
    and animals, unafraid,<br>
    will walk beside you,<br>
    and your child, tearless,<br>
    will run through meadows.
  </div>

  <div class="verse">
    And know this:<br>
    As long as seeds of kindness are cast into hearts,<br>
    and hands remain to plant a sapling,<br>
    hope will rise from the soil,<br>
    and the Earth will smile.
  </div>
