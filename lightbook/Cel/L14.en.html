  <h1>Tablet Fourteen</h1>
  <h2>On Peace, Patience, and Coexistence<br>From the Book of Hidden Light</h2>

  <p>O human,<br>
  I did not fashion you from dust<br>
  So you would boast of your own soil<br>
  Or lower a veil of hatred<br>
  Over a handful of earth.<br>
  I summoned you from light,<br>
  So you may shine, like a lamp in the wind,<br>
  Not only for yourself,<br>
  But for the passing stranger.<br>
  For if you are light,<br>
  And the other, too, is light,<br>
  Then night shall find no strength against you.</p>

  <p>I did not create you<br>
  To draw lines between hearts<br>
  Or build walls between souls<br>
  In My name.<br>
  My name is not a sword,<br>
  But a shield and sanctuary;<br>
  Not a border or barricade,<br>
  But a bridge between hearts.</p>

  <p>Whoever deems themselves a singular jewel<br>
  And sees others as stone or dust—<br>
  Though they praise My name a thousand times,<br>
  Their heart holds no share of My light.<br>
  For My breath does not fall<br>
  On those who see none but themselves upon the summit.</p>

  <p>But one who sits at the table of the stranger,<br>
  Eats the bread of humility,<br>
  And hears a foreign song<br>
  Without thorns in the ear of the heart—<br>
  That one knows My soul,<br>
  Without opening any book of faith<br>
  Or bearing a mark upon the brow.</p>

  <p>Whoever looks with kindness,<br>
  Be they with religion or without,<br>
  Speaking your tongue or silent,<br>
  Wearing your color or waving another banner—<br>
  If their heart is made of light<br>
  And their shadow harms no one,<br>
  They are kin to the radiance,<br>
  And in this caravan of creation,<br>
  They are your housemate of the soul.</p>

  <p>If anyone sheds blood in My name,<br>
  I will turn My face away.<br>
  For My name is a cup of love,<br>
  Not a poison for strife.</p>

  <p>And if the memory of Me<br>
  Sparks a fire in someone’s heart<br>
  Not of longing, but of hatred,<br>
  That memory shall fade from My mind.<br>
  For My flame warms the soul—<br>
  It does not burn it down.</p>

  <p>Peace is not merely the silence of swords,<br>
  But the gentle song of birds<br>
  On the branch of a tree<br>
  Whose roots reach into understanding,<br>
  And whose shade stretches over patience.</p>

  <p>Patience<br>
  Is not silence born of fear,<br>
  But the dignity of wisdom.<br>
  Know that each person<br>
  Is a traveler upon a path—<br>
  Many paths, perhaps,<br>
  But the destination is one.</p>

  <p>The one who shouts in the name of truth<br>
  Is not necessarily closer,<br>
  But the one who polishes their own mirror<br>
  And gazes inward<br>
  Before pointing out the flaws of others,<br>
  That one draws nearer to My threshold.</p>

  <p>Whoever makes of faith not a fortress,<br>
  But a window toward compassion,<br>
  And sees love<br>
  As wider than tongue, race, or nation—<br>
  I will behold them circling the light.</p>

  <p>O human,<br>
  From whichever road you come—<br>
  If your hand has soothed another’s wound,<br>
  And your gaze recites a poem of kindness,<br>
  I shall embrace you,<br>
  Not for who you are,<br>
  But for the light you carry.</p>

  <p>The world is not the home of a single tribe,<br>
  And I am not the god of one tongue or chosen clan.<br>
  I dwell in hearts<br>
  That, like springs,<br>
  Flow for all,<br>
  And deny water to none.</p>

  <p>I am a shelter above radiant hearts,<br>
  A refuge for those<br>
  Who believe in love—<br>
  Not in borders.</p>
