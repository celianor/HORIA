    <h1>Tablet V – On Education and the Child</h1>

    <p>O human,<br>
    When a child is born,<br>
    it is a part of your being,<br>
    a spark from the fire of My essence.<br>
    It is the echo of a future yet to come,<br>
    a gentle light<br>
    shining from your lantern of hope upon the earth.</p>

    <p>Be with them<br>
    as one is with a sprout in the soil;<br>
    not with the flood of commands,<br>
    nor with the blade of force,<br>
    but with the dew of kindness,<br>
    the sun of compassion,<br>
    and the patient whisper of presence.</p>

    <p>Education, if mixed with fear,<br>
    does not bear knowledge,<br>
    but becomes a cold shadow<br>
    upon the child’s soul,<br>
    from which they will flee,<br>
    not knowing why.</p>

    <p>Do not teach them<br>
    to become like you;<br>
    teach them<br>
    so they may find themselves,<br>
    and create a new path—<br>
    one your own imagination has not yet reached.</p>

    <p>Do not make their memory a stone tablet;<br>
    make their heart a field of rain,<br>
    for if their heart is free,<br>
    knowledge will blossom within,<br>
    like a joyful flower in the spring rain.</p>

    <p>O human,<br>
    every word you utter<br>
    is either a bridge to the world,<br>
    or a wall upon the soul.<br>
    And every glance of yours<br>
    is either a wing to soar,<br>
    or a chain of fear.</p>

    <p>Therefore, learn silence before speaking,<br>
    and humility before teaching;<br>
    for the true teacher<br>
    teaches through their presence,<br>
    not through words alone.</p>

    <p>Give them the lesson of life,<br>
    not through command,<br>
    nor through prohibition,<br>
    but through your being:<br>
    if you seek love, be loving;<br>
    if you seek truth, be true.</p>

    <p>I have placed<br>
    the silent secrets of the universe in the soul of the child;<br>
    do not let them be extinguished<br>
    in the noise of rules and reproach,<br>
    so they may not forget<br>
    who they are,<br>
    and where they came from.</p>

    <p>The future you hope for<br>
    will grow from their small hands,<br>
    not from your words or wishes.<br>
    So today,<br>
    be with them in such a way<br>
    that tomorrow,<br>
    they will remember you—<br>
    not with a heart full of anger,<br>
    but with a soft smile,<br>
    like the scent of a bright memory.</p>
