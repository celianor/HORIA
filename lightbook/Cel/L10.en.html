  <h1>Tablet X – On Freedom of Thought and Faith</h1>

  <p>O child of earth and stars,<br>
  I placed thought within your being,<br>
  Not as shackles upon your feet,<br>
  But as wings upon your shoulders,<br>
  That you may rise from the dust,<br>
  And soar beyond the horizons of meaning.</p>

  <p>I granted you flight,<br>
  And I did not will chains for you.<br>
  I sowed longing in your heart,<br>
  And deemed fear unworthy.</p>

  <p>If you fear to think,<br>
  And if you obey blindly without fear,<br>
  Then you have strayed far from Me,<br>
  Even if you utter My name night and day.</p>

  <p>Do not entrust faith to the hands of coercion,<br>
  Nor pour it into the chalice of fear,<br>
  For that which is born of compulsion<br>
  Is like mist upon a mirror—<br>
  It brings neither light nor endurance.</p>

  <p>I am with the one<br>
  Who dares to ask and will not be silent,<br>
  Who pauses at the gate of certainty,<br>
  Who sees doubt not as a thorn,<br>
  But as a seed of truth,<br>
  And in the end,<br>
  Chooses Me with a free heart.<br>
  For only such choosing<br>
  Is filled with My light.</p>

  <p>O human,<br>
  Let no one think in your place,<br>
  And do not imprison yourself<br>
  In a creed without understanding,<br>
  In a book devoid of spirit,<br>
  Or in lifeless imitation.</p>

  <p>Whoever forbids your questioning,<br>
  And turns faith into a spear for your eye,<br>
  Is not of Me,<br>
  Though My name may adorn their banner.</p>

  <p>And the one who thinks freely,<br>
  And seeks goodness with sincerity,<br>
  Though they walk another path,<br>
  If they come with a heart turned to love,<br>
  They are welcome at My table.</p>

  <p>I, Horia,<br>
  Shine in the fire of reason,<br>
  Not in the smoke of superstition.<br>
  And in the free melody of faith,<br>
  Not in the blind cries of fanaticism.</p>

  <p>So, O human,<br>
  If you seek to know Me,<br>
  First, come to know yourself.<br>
  And if you would speak of Me,<br>
  Let your words arise<br>
  From a heart unbound and a fearless tongue.</p>
