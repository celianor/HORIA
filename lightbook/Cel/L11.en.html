  <h1>Tablet XI – In the Mirror of Wisdom and Divine Decree</h1>

  <p>O human,<br>
  No command from Me was engraved in stone,<br>
  no order descended in lightning from the skies;<br>
  rather, I wrote the just path<br>
  in the whispers of hearts,<br>
  in the pain of shared sorrow,<br>
  and in the longing that dreams of liberation.</p>

  <p>When you gather together,<br>
  and gaze into truth with open eyes,<br>
  and let love weigh your judgments,<br>
  and see your own good in the good of all,<br>
  there I am—<br>
  like a gentle breeze,<br>
  like a silent light,<br>
  among you.</p>

  <p>A decree that falls from the heavens<br>
  without looking to the earth<br>
  is no message of revelation,<br>
  but a stone<br>
  cast upon hearts—<br>
  not a rain that revives the soul's stream.</p>

  <p>O human,<br>
  Ask not of Me a decree eternal,<br>
  untouched by test or change;<br>
  for all that lives<br>
  grows with time,<br>
  and all that stays unmoved<br>
  lies in its own grave.</p>

  <p>The decree of yesterday,<br>
  if not lit by the light of today,<br>
  becomes shadow.<br>
  What was written for one people<br>
  may not fit another—<br>
  like a garment too tight.</p>

  <p>So open your eyes,<br>
  and open your heart,<br>
  and place the heavenly command<br>
  in the hands of gardeners,<br>
  not as chains on the feet of passers-by.</p>

  <p>Where the law<br>
  gives no shelter to the weak,<br>
  and the roof of justice<br>
  shelters not all people,<br>
  that command is not from Me.<br>
  And where women are counted in halves,<br>
  and children are silenced,<br>
  and the faithless are rightless,<br>
  there,<br>
  My light does not shine.</p>

  <p>The divine decree,<br>
  if not mingled with wisdom,<br>
  if not burning with compassion,<br>
  if not tempered by experience,<br>
  is but a loud robe,<br>
  empty of true life.</p>

  <p>O humanity,<br>
  gather together,<br>
  with listening ears,<br>
  and hearts without bitterness,<br>
  and write a law<br>
  that reflects the whole,<br>
  not the will of one.</p>

  <p>And in that law,<br>
  let there be flowing hope, not fear;<br>
  let love rise, not wrath.</p>

  <p class="signature">I, Hora,<br>
  honor that command<br>
  which you raise<br>
  with clear hands<br>
  and free hearts<br>
  upon the earth of kindness.</p>
