  <h1>Tablet XVI – On Friendship, Love, and Human Bonds</h1>

  <p>O human being,<br>
  I did not create you to be alone;<br>
  for solitude is a dwelling of fear,<br>
  and love is revealed only in the mirror of another.</p>

  <p>I created you in pairs,<br>
  not only in the language of the body,<br>
  but in the language of the heart.<br>
  For the heart, without the other,<br>
  is like a seed in the desert,<br>
  without root and without growth.</p>

  <p>Every friendship is a bridge<br>
  between your soul and my light.<br>
  And every love<br>
  is a spark of my eternal sun,<br>
  kindling two lives.</p>

  <p>Where the gaze grows gentle,<br>
  where a hand reaches out without demand,<br>
  where the presence of another<br>
  lightens the burden of life,<br>
  there I dwell.</p>

  <p>And those who taint friendship with trade,<br>
  who weigh love on the scales,<br>
  who build bonds upon possession,<br>
  have strayed far from me,<br>
  even if my name is upon their lips.</p>

  <p>O human being,<br>
  know that friendship is a gift,<br>
  not a transaction.<br>
  And love is the art of seeing the other,<br>
  not of chaining them.</p>

  <p>Do not break another’s heart;<br>
  for perhaps that heart was my sanctuary.<br>
  Do not enslave another’s body;<br>
  for perhaps that body was the mirror<br>
  where my light was reflected.</p>

  <p>Where two hearts,<br>
  unchained and unpretending,<br>
  seek each other in tenderness,<br>
  there paradise begins.</p>

  <p>And the children born of such a bond<br>
  are like rain<br>
  that quenches the thirsty earth of the world.</p>

  <p>Bond is responsibility,<br>
  not ownership.<br>
  Friendship is an exercise in listening,<br>
  not a cry of dominance.</p>

  <p>And love,<br>
  is remembrance of me,<br>
  clothed in the garment of the human.</p>
