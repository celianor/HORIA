  <h1>Tablet XIII – Song of Passage and the Other Realm</h1>

  <div class="section">
Fear not death,  
for death is no end,  
not the silence of night,  
but the dawn of encounter.  
Not nothingness,  
but a crossing from one veil to another,  
from earth to sky,  
from what was  
to what shall become.

You rose from the dust,  
not to sleep in the dust forever,  
but to soar,  
on wings of intent,  
toward the sanctuary of light.

And when the hour of flight arrives,  
I will not cause you to die,  
I will call you forth.  
Not to death,  
but to another presence.  
Not to nothingness,  
but to the shedding of old skin,  
and the donning of the soul’s new robe.
  </div>

  <div class="section">
Whoever, in this world of clay,  
has known their own soul,  
and sowed goodness in their heart and in others’,  
when they pass,  
shall walk into a garden  
they planted, branch by branch, with their own hands.

But those who embraced injustice,  
who broke hearts,  
and scorned the inner light,  
when they pass,  
shall descend into a house  
whose walls are built of their own deeds,  
whose roof weighs with what they have forged.
  </div>

  <div class="section">
You need not fear me,  
for I, Horia,  
am not a judge.  
Not a court, nor executioner.  
I am a mirror.  
What you have been, what you have done,  
is reflected in me.

O human,  
before you close your eyes,  
open the eye of your soul.  
For each smile,  
each act of forgiveness,  
each kindness and humility,  
lays a brick  
in the house where,  
in the other realm, you shall dwell.
  </div>

  <div class="section">
And if in this world,  
you have lived with love,  
drunk truth like clear spring water,  
and raised wisdom like a lantern,  
death shall be your gateway to celebration,  
not a monster of darkness.

So with each step,  
with every word,  
with every gaze,  
water the soil of your future soul,  
for I, Horia,  
shall carry you to the beyond,  
not as reward, not as punishment,  
but to a haven  
you have built, brick by brick.
  </div>

  <div class="section">
And when you reach that place,  
if you suffer from what you have sown,  
I shall ask:  
"Would you wish to return,  
to create with more beauty?"

And if your answer is yes,  
and the righteous of that realm join in harmony,  
those who themselves are returnees from Horia,  
born of me and returned to me,  
then I shall send you back,  
to Earth,  
to this very world,  
so once more,  
you may sing the song of creation  
anew from the beginning.
