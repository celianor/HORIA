    <h1>Tablet IV – On Freedom of Thought and Expression</h1>

    <p>O human,<br>
    I have granted you thought,<br>
    not as a burden on your shoulders,<br>
    but as wings for your soul,<br>
    so you may descend into your depths,<br>
    and from there,<br>
    soar to the horizons of knowledge.</p>

    <p>Thought, when imprisoned,<br>
    is like a bird<br>
    that gazes not at the sky,<br>
    but at the ceiling of its cage.<br>
    And speech, when it rises in fear,<br>
    is a half-life yearning to break free;<br>
    it neither grows nor enlightens.</p>

    <p>O human,<br>
    Give every thought a chance to speak,<br>
    even the one that tastes bitter,<br>
    for truth is sometimes hidden<br>
    in a cup of bitterness.<br>
    And listen to every voice,<br>
    for the ear is noble<br>
    when it hears even the harshest tones<br>
    without flinching,<br>
    or losing sight of the truth.</p>

    <p>I do not ask you to believe every thought,<br>
    but to release each one<br>
    into the field of dialogue,<br>
    so your soul<br>
    may choose its own path.<br>
    For in silencing others,<br>
    there is no victory,<br>
    no awakening,<br>
    but only the withering of the spirit<br>
    and the extinction of the soul’s light.</p>

    <p>O human,<br>
    the one who fears another’s speech<br>
    may be a herald of a truth<br>
    they cannot bear to hear.<br>
    And the one who seals mouths<br>
    with the sickle of fear<br>
    is neither a guardian of faith<br>
    nor a protector of knowledge;<br>
    he is a shadow<br>
    cast upon his own soul<br>
    more than an enemy of others.</p>

    <p>Let no word dry<br>
    upon another’s lips,<br>
    and let no thought<br>
    perish in imposed silence.<br>
    For when mouths are sealed,<br>
    hearts too grow quiet,<br>
    and from dead hearts,<br>
    no beautiful melody<br>
    can arise.</p>
