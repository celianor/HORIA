    <h1>Tablet VII – On Truth and the Oversight of Power</h1>
    
    <div class="verse">O human,<br>
    I did not create power for you to rule,<br>
    but to serve,<br>
    not upon a throne, but among the people,<br>
    like a hand that holds a lantern,<br>
    not one that burns the possessions of others.</div>

    <div class="verse">Where power is left unchecked,<br>
    temptation lies in wait,<br>
    and truth is the first victim of thrones unchallenged.</div>

    <div class="verse">Whoever gains power<br>
    bears a burden of trust,<br>
    not a goblet of pride.<br>
    And whoever blinds himself to his own faults,<br>
    and deafens his ears to the people,<br>
    even if he speaks in the name of justice,<br>
    is far from My path.</div>

    <div class="verse">O human,<br>
    truth is the canopy of power.<br>
    Without truth,<br>
    power turns into oppression,<br>
    like stagnant water that becomes foul.</div>

    <div class="verse">So whoever you entrust with a task,<br>
    test their truthfulness, not their voice.<br>
    And whoever you raise higher,<br>
    demand greater accountability,<br>
    not greater freedom.</div>

    <div class="verse">And when you yourself hold power,<br>
    seek a mirror,<br>
    not blind flatterers.<br>
    For you too are made of dust,<br>
    and error dwells within your nature.</div>

    <div class="verse">Therefore, establish laws,<br>
    not to dominate,<br>
    but to protect yourself from yourself,<br>
    so that when you forget,<br>
    they may remind you.</div>

    <div class="verse">O human,<br>
    all power without the people's eye is blind,<br>
    and without free questioning, it goes mad and tyrannical.<br>
    Let the watchers question,<br>
    and take no offense,<br>
    for that is guardianship, not ingratitude.</div>

    <div class="verse">I cherish the ruler<br>
    who obeys the people.<br>
    And I despise the one who, in My name,<br>
    sews mouths shut,<br>
    and chains the truth.</div>

  </div>
