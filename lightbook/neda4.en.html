  <h1>Book of Lights | Illuminating Calls</h1>
  <h2>The Fourth Call: Beyond the Passage, the Song of Hura</h2>

  <p>You who rose from dust and gazed upon the light,</p>
  <p>Know that death is neither an end nor a void,</p>
  <p>But a path toward clarity, a passage to a new horizon.</p>

  <p>You were not made to burn like a candle and fade away,</p>
  <p>But to blaze like a fierce flame,</p>
  <p>And cross the bonds of the body,</p>
  <p>To enter a realm where thoughts live,</p>
  <p>And intentions take shape and meaning.</p>

  <p>Death is neither fear nor falsehood,</p>
  <p>But a mirror revealing your inner self,</p>
  <p>Not to judge, but to know,</p>
  <p>Not to punish, but to understand.</p>

  <p>O traveler on the path of trial,</p>
  <p>Know that beyond this passage,</p>
  <p>Another spectacle awaits you;</p>
  <p>Deeper, wider, more real.</p>

  <p>In that land,</p>
  <p>Language is not only speech,</p>
  <p>Light and shadow also carry messages,</p>
  <p>And it is not your name nor your tribe, but what you have sown in your heart.</p>

  <p>God is there with you too,</p>
  <p>Not as a judge, but as a caring gardener,</p>
  <p>Who has waited years for your life to bloom.</p>

  <p>If you have nurtured kindness in your heart, you will taste kindness,</p>
  <p>If you have given, your gift will cover you,</p>
  <p>And if you have chased loneliness from others’ hearts,</p>
  <p>Then there, loneliness will no longer hurt you.</p>

  <p>In the life beyond,</p>
  <p>You will no longer be just a receiver,</p>
  <p>But a creator,</p>
  <p>A creator of a new world, with thought and love.</p>

  <p>The seed, when it ripens, produces seeds itself,</p>
  <p>You too, if your soul has learned the light,</p>
  <p>Will become a creator beyond this world.</p>

  <p>Do not see death as a certificate of fear,</p>
  <p>But as an invitation from me,</p>
  <p>To a feast of wisdom and love,</p>
  <p>Where you will be a precious guest.</p>
