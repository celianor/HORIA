  <h1>Tablet IX – On the Sanctity of Languages and Cultures</h1>

  <p>O human,<br>
  Do you know that I<br>
  kindled languages like sparks from a single fire,<br>
  from one sacred hearth,<br>
  so that every people, in the solitude of their nights,<br>
  might whisper to Me in their own voice?<br>
  Languages are threads of light<br>
  shining from the lantern of the human heart<br>
  in a thousand directions.</p>

  <p>We have all boiled from the same spring,<br>
  yet our vessels bear colors and patterns of their own.<br>
  One weeps in song,<br>
  another roars in silence,<br>
  but both are melodies<br>
  in the presence of <strong>Horia</strong>.</p>

  <p>If you do not understand a tongue,<br>
  bow your head before this unfamiliar prayer,<br>
  and listen—<br>
  for perhaps you shall hear a voice<br>
  from your own hidden self.</p>

  <p>Words are leaves of an ancient tree<br>
  rooted in love;<br>
  some blossom in your mother tongue,<br>
  and some in faraway gardens—<br>
  but their fragrance is the same:<br>
  the scent of the human soul.</p>

  <p>The culture of every people<br>
  is a river flowing from the mountains of their being,<br>
  shaped by the stones of history, twisted with joy and sorrow,<br>
  and whenever it reaches the sea,<br>
  it carries a drop of <strong>Horia</strong>'s truth within it.</p>

  <p>Let no language fall silent<br>
  like a bird caged by shame or fury.<br>
  Let no culture veil its face in disgrace,<br>
  for in every silenced tongue,<br>
  a call from Me remains unanswered;<br>
  and in every forgotten culture,<br>
  a crack appears in the chalice of unity.</p>

  <p>Do not confine wisdom<br>
  to one tongue, one land, one color.<br>
  Wisdom is a free wind<br>
  that blows from the lips of elders and children,<br>
  from clay bricks and golden books<br>
  alike.</p>

  <p>Speak to your child<br>
  in the language of their first dawns—<br>
  not from habit,<br>
  but from reverence.<br>
  For that language<br>
  is the language of their earliest dreams,<br>
  their nameless smile,<br>
  their unspoken tears.</p>

  <p>O human,<br>
  in every language, there is a trace of Me,<br>
  and in every culture, a mirror of My beauty.<br>
  If you listen with the ear of the heart,<br>
  each language is a verse from the Book of the Soul.</p>

  <p>When you speak with a stranger,<br>
  listen as if in prayer;<br>
  and when you encounter another culture,<br>
  be within your heart a gentle pilgrim—<br>
  not a loveless judge.</p>
