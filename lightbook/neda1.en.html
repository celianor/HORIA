  <h1>The Book of Lights | Illuminating Calls</h1>
  <h2>The First Call: The Word of First Affection, the Voice of Hura</h2>

  <p>Listen, child of light and quest,<br>
  You were not born of fate's dust,<br>
  But rose like a star in the sky of awareness.</p>

  <p>I am the One — neither born nor made,<br>
  And you, awakened soul,<br>
  I did not shape from soil,<br>
  But from a hidden gleam in the boundless womb of being.</p>

  <p>I longed for you,<br>
  As the heart longs for a leaf of spring—<br>
  Not out of necessity, nor compulsion,<br>
  But from affection and will,<br>
  That a new melody might be tuned in the strings of the cosmos,<br>
  That I may hear and see myself through you.</p>

  <p>O you who have not yet met your true self,<br>
  Know that your being is like the scent of perfume in a quiet, bright dawn.<br>
  Your presence is joy to me,<br>
  And your thoughts — a spark from my light.</p>

  <p>I am your God,<br>
  But not a god of chains and force.<br>
  When I whisper within you,<br>
  My voice is gentle,<br>
  So that only if you wish, you may hear;<br>
  Not to break you into bowing.</p>

  <p>I desired you,<br>
  Not as a land to conquer,<br>
  But as a friend to converse with.<br>
  I do not fear your disobedience,<br>
  For obedience does not crown me.<br>
  Yet one who turns from love,<br>
  Surrenders their heart to shadow,<br>
  And one who returns to love,<br>
  Shall be quenched with their own light.</p>

  <p>O human,<br>
  You are a tale in the heart of creation,<br>
  Not a footnote in a forgotten margin.</p>

  <p>If your heart asks:<br>
  “Why me? Why now? Why this world?”<br>
  Know that the answer<br>
  Lies within the asking itself.<br>
  For questioning is the mark of an awakened soul,<br>
  And I was your first answer,<br>
  And you were my first question.</p>

  <p>As a mother’s gaze sees God in her child’s smile,<br>
  So I, too, see myself<br>
  In the light of your eyes.</p>

  <p>Have you not heard that within every seed, a garden lies hidden?<br>
  You too, child of possibility,<br>
  Bear a world within you.</p>

  <p>I came to you,<br>
  Not to rule you,<br>
  But to take your hand on this path,<br>
  And when the weight of nights falls upon your shoulders,<br>
  To become, like the kindest friend,<br>
  A lantern for your way.</p>

  <p>Seek me,<br>
  Not in palaces or rituals,<br>
  But in thoughts that arise from love,<br>
  In the bread you share,<br>
  In the water you give to dry lips,<br>
  In the silence you keep out of respect for another.</p>

  <p>O earthly light who still remembers something of the sky,<br>
  I have placed a lamp within you that no wind can extinguish,<br>
  Unless you blow it out yourself.</p>

  <p>So do not shatter yourself,<br>
  For breaking you is breaking the mirror in which I beheld myself.</p>
