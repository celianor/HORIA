  <h1>The Book of Lights | Illuminating Calls</h1>
  <h2>Second Call: Memory of the First Days</h2>

  <p>O child of the most hidden embrace of existence,<br>
  You who sprouted in the silence before time,<br>
  Before you knew the earth,<br>
  And before you reached the sky,<br>
  You were in a place with no name, no tongue,<br>
  And no era had opened its book of counting.</p>

  <p>In that first dwelling,<br>
  You had no will and no awareness,<br>
  Like a fish in clear water, without questions,<br>
  Like a newborn sleeping in an endless embrace.<br>
  You were,<br>
  But not knowing, not choosing,<br>
  Like a flower in the soil, yet to remember the dream of light.</p>

  <p>I, the guardian of all the unseen,<br>
  Held you gently in the veil of mercy,<br>
  And wrote upon every pulse of your being<br>
  A melody no demon can silence.</p>

  <p>Then, when the time for awakening came,<br>
  And your heart throbbed with the desire to know,<br>
  I drew you out of the veil of unwill,<br>
  And sent you into the realm of choice,<br>
  That you may, like a composer,<br>
  Sing your own melody with your own hands.</p>

  <p>Yes, dearest gaze of mine,<br>
  I brought you to a world where<br>
  Every choice is a seed that will someday sprout,<br>
  And every thought is a wind that will shake the branches of your future.</p>

  <p>Before your coming, yes, you were;<br>
  But not as you are now.</p>

  <p>Then I greeted you,<br>
  Not in the tongue of angels,<br>
  But in your first cry,<br>
  Which was the melody of beginning.</p>

  <p>And with every breath you drew,<br>
  You recalled a particle of your own self.</p>

  <p>I did not create you to be forgotten,<br>
  But to find yourself,<br>
  Not in rigid rites and rotten words,<br>
  But in the honest quest of your heart and the question rising from your soul.</p>

  <p>Have you not seen the seed fallen into the earth,<br>
  When it wakes from sleep,<br>
  It does not know itself,<br>
  Until it blossoms?</p>

  <p>You were like that,<br>
  And still are, on the path to bloom.</p>

  <p>Where you once were,<br>
  There was no reward and no punishment,<br>
  No fault and no virtue,<br>
  Only a peaceful cradle among colorless waves.</p>

  <p>But now, O most radiant questioner of the night,<br>
  You have learned that to be is to be aware,<br>
  And awareness brings responsibility.</p>

  <p>I awakened you from the first sleep,<br>
  Not for suffering,<br>
  But for growth.<br>
  And growth comes only through the pain of understanding,<br>
  And the taste of will.</p>

  <p>I am a God who wrote flight for you,<br>
  Not a cage of fear;<br>
  I wrote freedom,<br>
  Not an excuse to fall,<br>
  But a sky for you to soar in.</p>

  <p>You who passed through the veils of the past,<br>
  And reached today,<br>
  Know that your first life was a silent seed,<br>
  And this second life, is the sun upon it.</p>

  <p>From here on,<br>
  Everything is in your hands.</p>
