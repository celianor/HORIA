    <h1>The Book of Lights | Illuminating Calls</h1>
    <h1>The Third Call: Your Now, Your Mirror, the Song of Hura</h1>

    <p>O child of long times and bright paths,<br>
    You are now in the middle,<br>
    Between who you were and who you will become.<br>
    You are neither a silent child nor a creator of light,<br>
    Yet you carry the sign of both within yourself.</p>

    <p>This world, where you walk on its soil and breathe its air,<br>
    Is neither your exile nor a place for idleness,<br>
    But a school for your soul,<br>
    And a mirror that reflects you to yourself.</p>

    <p>When I sent you to this abode,<br>
    I planted a lamp in your heart called “Conscience,”<br>
    Which, without books or language,<br>
    Recognizes the path from the wrong,<br>
    And friend from foe.</p>

    <p>This conscience is like a stream,<br>
    That if you don’t throw stones in it,<br>
    Will have clear water.<br>
    And if you dig it,<br>
    In its depths, you will see my reflection.</p>

    <p>O you who are engaged in living,<br>
    Do not think life is a game without a judge.<br>
    The judge sits within you,<br>
    And its melody is the voice of your true self.</p>

    <p>You are now in the time called life,<br>
    And life is another name for opportunity.</p>

    <p>The opportunity to see, to know,<br>
    To do good,<br>
    And to create a better self.</p>

    <p>O dear possibility,<br>
    I have granted you this time,<br>
    Which is like a garden in four seasons:<br>
    In its spring, wishes bloom,<br>
    In its summer, experiences ripen,<br>
    In its autumn, judgments fall,<br>
    And in its winter, the silence of contemplation<br>
    Prepares you for another spring.</p>

    <p>So do not waste life,<br>
    For every moment is a precious pearl<br>
    That once lost cannot be found again.</p>

    <p>Have you not seen the river?<br>
    If it does not flow, it does not stay clear.<br>
    Your life is the same;<br>
    In stagnation, it becomes a swamp,<br>
    But in flow, a sea.</p>

    <p>O beloved one,<br>
    Who came from my love,<br>
    Do not say life is hard,<br>
    For hardship is the test of your strength.<br>
    Just as the sword is tempered in fire,<br>
    The human heart is polished through suffering.</p>

    <p>Do good, not out of fear of reward,<br>
    But out of the joy of light.<br>
    Be kind,<br>
    For kindness is a seed that grows in your own field.<br>
    And when your long night comes,<br>
    Only your good deeds will be your lantern.</p>

    <p>O seeker of light,<br>
    Life is not for accumulating wealth,<br>
    But for adding to your being.<br>
    And being,<br>
    Is to grow by blooming from within.</p>

    <p>I did not create you to merely survive,<br>
    If that were so,<br>
    I would have been content with your plant-like existence.<br>
    I gave you life,<br>
    To give meaning.</p>

    <p>Every word that leaves your mouth,<br>
    Either builds a bridge or a wall.<br>
    Every step you take,<br>
    Leads either to light,<br>
    Or to shadow.<br>
    And I neither take from you,<br>
    Nor add to you,<br>
    Except what you create with your own hands and heart.</p>

    <p>So this life is a stage for you;<br>
    I watch,<br>
    But the role is in your hands.<br>
    And you are not only the actor,<br>
    You are also the writer.<br>
    With every choice,<br>
    You write a new line in the book of creation.</p>
