  <main>
    <p>O child of long times and shining paths,</p>
    <p>Now you stand at the center,</p>
    <p>Between what you were and what you will be.</p>
    <p>You are neither the silent child nor the light’s creator,</p>
    <p>But you carry a trace of both inside you.</p>

    <p>This world where you walk and breathe,</p>
    <p>Is not an exile nor a playground,</p>
    <p>But a school for your soul,</p>
    <p>And a mirror reflecting your being.</p>

    <p>When I sent you to this place,</p>
    <p>I put in your heart a light called “consciousness”,</p>
    <p>It needs no book nor language,</p>
    <p>It discerns the path of error,</p>
    <p>And the friend from the foe.</p>

    <p>This consciousness is like a stream,</p>
    <p>If you do not block it with stones,</p>
    <p>It stays clear.</p>
    <p>And if you dig it,</p>
    <p>You will see my reflection in it.</p>

    <p>O you busy living,</p>
    <p>Do not think life is a game without judge,</p>
    <p>The wise sit inside you,</p>
    <p>And their melody is your true voice.</p>

    <p>Now you are in a time called life,</p>
    <p>And life is another name for opportunity.</p>

    <p>Opportunity to see, opportunity to know,</p>
    <p>Opportunity to do good,</p>
    <p>And opportunity to create your best self.</p>

    <p>O beloved of potential,</p>
    <p>I gave you this time,</p>
    <p>Like a garden in four seasons:</p>
    <p>In its spring desires bloom,</p>
    <p>In its summer experiences ripen,</p>
    <p>In its autumn judgments fall,</p>
    <p>And in its winter, the silence of contemplation,</p>
    <p>Preparing you for a new spring.</p>

    <p>Do not waste your life,</p>
    <p>Each moment is a precious jewel</p>
    <p>That never returns once passed.</p>

    <p>Have you not looked at the river?</p>
    <p>If it does not flow, it does not stay clear.</p>
    <p>Your life is the same,</p>
    <p>In stagnation it becomes a puddle,</p>
    <p>And in flowing it becomes a sea.</p>

    <p>O the one who loves you,</p>
    <p>And came from my love,</p>
    <p>Do not say life is hard,</p>
    <p>Adversity is the measure of your strength.</p>
    <p>Like swords are polished in fire,</p>
    <p>The heart is cleansed in pain.</p>

    <p>Be good, not out of fear of punishment,</p>
    <p>But out of longing for the light.</p>
    <p>Be compassionate,</p>
    <p>Compassion is a seed that grows in your field.</p>
    <p>And when the long night comes,</p>
    <p>Only your kindness will be your lamp.</p>

    <p>O seeker of light,</p>
    <p>Life is not to accumulate,</p>
    <p>But to add existence.</p>
    <p>Existence,</p>
    <p>When it blooms from inside you.</p>

    <p>I did not create you only to live,</p>
    <p>If that were enough,</p>
    <p>Your plant would suffice.</p>
    <p>I gave you the soul,</p>
    <p>To give meaning.</p>

    <p>Every word that comes out of your mouth,</p>
    <p>Builds a bridge or a wall.</p>
    <p>Every step you take,</p>
    <p>Is towards the light,</p>
    <p>Or towards the shadow.</p>
    <p>I take nothing from you,</p>
    <p>Nor add anything to you,</p>
    <p>Except what you do with your hands and your heart.</p>

    <p>Life is a theatre for you;</p>
    <p>I watch,</p>
    <p>But the role is in your hands.</p>
    <p>You are not just the actor,</p>
    <p>But also its writer.</p>
    <p>With every choice,</p>
    <p>You write a new line in the book of creation.</p>
