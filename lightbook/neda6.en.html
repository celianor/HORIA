  <main>
    <p>O you, in whom the breeze of my love blows,</p>
    <p>Know that the first sign of Me in your heart is kindness.</p>
    <p>Kindness is not a weak compassion,</p>
    <p>But the highest form of wisdom.</p>
    <p>Kindness is not a rootless gentleness,</p>
    <p>But the knowledge of the heart,</p>
    <p>Like a tree nourished at the spring of understanding existence.</p>

    <p>O child of light,</p>
    <p>Every time you offer a smile to a human being,</p>
    <p>You gladden My heart.</p>
    <p>And every time you soothe a soul,</p>
    <p>You release the world from an invisible turmoil,</p>
    <p>Yet the source of many sorrows.</p>

    <p>Do not say: "What can I do?"</p>
    <p>For a drop of love recreates the ocean.</p>
    <p>And every hand extended with love</p>
    <p>Is a gate opened toward the portals of light.</p>

    <p>I made you to be like a candle,</p>
    <p>That burns to light others,</p>
    <p>Not a dead torch, surrendered to darkness.</p>

    <p>Kindness flows from within,</p>
    <p>Not from command.</p>
    <p>And one who orders love</p>
    <p>Creates only an appearance.</p>
    <p>But one who teaches love through action</p>
    <p>Invites the world into warmth.</p>

    <p>O you, seeker of completeness,</p>
    <p>Know that no one becomes whole by remaining alone.</p>
    <p>In the connection of hearts, the human soul grows,</p>
    <p>And I, God, dwell among united hearts.</p>

    <p>Wisdom is true when it is empathic.</p>
    <p>And thought shines when it lights the collective.</p>
    <p>So consult, converse, listen.</p>
    <p>For I placed a light in every servantâ€™s words,</p>
    <p>And the one who listens only to himself</p>
    <p>Misses half of creation.</p>

    <p>No people grow under a single voice,</p>
    <p>And no nation shines by selfishness.</p>
    <p>Collective wisdom is a rain from many springs,</p>
    <p>Which, together, make the land fertile.</p>

    <p>Helping your neighbor is a silent prayer.</p>
    <p>It needs no ritual, no display,</p>
    <p>But within it, the heart is cleansed,</p>
    <p>And the soul turns to God,</p>
    <p>Without even saying His name.</p>

    <p>O you who have a hand to give,</p>
    <p>Know that I gave you that hand to share,</p>
    <p>And a heart to understand that the other also suffers,</p>
    <p>Perhaps hidden behind a smile.</p>

    <p>Every time you lighten the burden of a human being,</p>
    <p>Truly, you ease your own burden too.</p>
    <p>And every time you share your bread,</p>
    <p>A hidden light appears,</p>
    <p>Which, returning to you, will transform your life.</p>

    <p>Love, even in the desert,</p>
    <p>For every seed of love will one day bloom in an unseen land.</p>
    <p>And if you feel tired of kindness,</p>
    <p>Know that you are only far from love,</p>
    <p>And you are not tired,</p>
    <p>For love itself dissolves all fatigue.</p>

    <p>O My beloved child,</p>
    <p>If you want to come closer to Me,</p>
    <p>Build a home in the heart of another.</p>
    <p>For My dwelling is in hearts,</p>
    <p>Not on domes or minarets.</p>
    <p>And whoever lights the heart of another,</p>
    <p>Also lights My heart.</p>
