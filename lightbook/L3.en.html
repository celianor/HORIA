  <h1>Tablet III ‚Äì On Opinion and Deliberation</h1>

  <p><strong>In praise of dialogue, collaboration, and the right to be heard</strong></p>

  <p>O human,<br>
  You are not alone on this winding path;<br>
  Destiny is a fabric woven by many hands.<br>
  You are not an isolated island,<br>
  Choosing your way of life in solitude,<br>
  But a link in the chain of existence;<br>
  You walk alongside others,<br>
  You see, listen, and build with them.</p>

  <p>When hearts gather,<br>
  And tongues do not tremble in fear of silence,<br>
  And every thought is given space to blossom,<br>
  Wisdom will rise from the depths of all;<br>
  Not from one, but from a thousand searching souls.</p>

  <p>I see opinion as a flame from the torch of liberty,<br>
  And deliberation as a lantern in the darkness of doubt.<br>
  And whoever rules alone,<br>
  Though crowned,<br>
  Is far from my path;<br>
  For to govern without the people's voice<br>
  Is not service, but domination;<br>
  Not leadership, but the erosion of souls.</p>

  <p>O human,<br>
  Your opinion, if it rises from an awakened heart and enlightened mind,<br>
  Is a living essence,<br>
  By which tomorrow can be built,<br>
  Not by the sword, but by thought.<br>
  And if this jewel is taken from you,<br>
  It is as if they seek you silent,<br>
  Though your cry echoes in your throat.</p>

  <p>Whoever disregards the people's voice,<br>
  Or steals it from them,<br>
  Is in conflict with me, with Horia;<br>
  Even if they speak my name,<br>
  Even if they sit upon a lofty throne.</p>

  <p>Know that opinion is a shared dignity;<br>
  Dependent on neither age,<br>
  Nor lineage, nor gender, nor status.<br>
  Whether it comes from an untested youth,<br>
  Or a seasoned elder,<br>
  Whether it aligns with yours,<br>
  Or brings another view;<br>
  All count,<br>
  All are equal in worth.</p>

  <p>And be aware:<br>
  In deliberation, seek only the truth,<br>
  Not shaky conveniences,<br>
  Nor false fears,<br>
  Nor the uproar of unthinking majorities.<br>
  Silence no idea out of fear of difference;<br>
  For salvation may lie in the lone voice,<br>
  And deliverance in a thought yet unborn.</p>

  <p>O human,<br>
  If you want the light of your home to stay lit,<br>
  Let every glimmer shine,<br>
  Even the faintest.<br>
  And if you want your land to endure,<br>
  Honor the people‚Äôs opinion;<br>
  Not just when it serves you,<br>
  But especially when it does not.</p>
